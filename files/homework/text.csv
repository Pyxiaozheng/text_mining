"Major privacy concerns. My major complaint has to do with the utter lack of privacy. WHY does Facebook/Instagram need my health info, browsing history, tracking location, contact list, identifiers, purchases, financial info, sensitive info to post a picture?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Privacy Control. Why would Instagram need my data in Health, Fitness, Financial records, Sensitive Info and audio files among other things? And why isnt there a way to stop the app from collecting this data?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I have a major problem with how Instagram and Facebook handle their users data. I do not want to be filmed or recorded or my information sold. I do not want Instagram to have access to anything on my phone unless Im posting if. I do not want women and minorities to be targeted and have their accounts shut down because they show some skin or post their onlyfans when actual racists incite violence. Its honestly ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram collects your data and censors freedom of speech. I do not agree with the way Instagram (Facebook) censors freedom of speech. Censors peoples bodies. And data mines all of your information. Not ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. Designed to take your information and access to your privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look how much data they collect. Why does Instagram need to kmow all this stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Instagram sells so much data to its advertising companies by all means necessary would advice others to avoid the Meta universe, your data would be sold and they would profit off it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ads, privacy infringement, and content ownership. Slightly less than half of what I see as I scroll through my feed is actually content from accounts Ive chosen to follow. The rest is from ads and accounts that Instagram WANTS me to follow. And I never see some content for the accounts I follow at all because of Instas algorithms.On top of that, Insta [Meta] owns ask content that you post.On top of that, they have access to many parts of your phone and collect your information.Im nearly ready to leave the platform for good. Its nothing like it was when I joined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DATA POLICY. PLEASE READ DATA POLICY Instagram is now a creep just like most apps but. They actually went above and beyond to creep you out. And they dont want you finding out its in fine print. They have ownership over photos even if its in your camera roll seriously read the whole thing it takes for ever but they are doing some weird stuff on the other side. Screw you gram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why financial & health information???. I do not understand the need for Apple to share so much information from my device to Instagram without an option to opt out. I do have the option to delete the app and login from the browser however, that is not the kind of customer experience I initially signed up for. Over access to information by a company that currently owns monopoly and continues to merge my data across platforms is always helped by another Giant. Apple &amp; Facebook, this may be my rare reviews but hey well, you deserved none of that single star.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much data collection. Before you use this bare in mind its owned by Facebook. The amount of data it collects on you is vast - your financial data, your contacts, health and fitness data and on and on and on. These people will know more about you than you do in a few days. Its a high price to hand over your privacy so your mates can see a photo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. Policy that is being changed is an invasion of privacy and Instagram should not have the power/ freedoms to be able to have access to everything on our phones from our photos and texts to our exact location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook should be regulated like a media company. First off when I selected to rate this app. It already had a pre written review.Second off the app keeps showing me people Im not following or interested in.Third off the app decides what you see and who youre shown to. This is why Facebook is a media company and should be regulated like one.Social networking is to socializing as reality tv is to reality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals data, supports racism. Facebook and Instagram steal data and suppress minority thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Give us our privacy. Privacy is important. Policies allowing all our information to be documented are not right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We need regulation. Addictive and it knows what its doing. Social media is bad for us. Our brains werent built for it, and it is hurting us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sam. This new policy that they are putting on is going to make people stop using Instagram because its so many rules that dont need to be there, and if Instagram is getting it then Facebook should too, this new policy is so terrible Im deleting Instagram cause I dont wanna deal with all that nonsense. Like just let people be,do what they want if they have a problem with it then its their problem,let them report it, not have all our private information, it like their trying to keep us under surveillance and if we do one wrong thing its bye bye, so dumb I hate whoever put this new policy on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Privacy Policy is invasive. Used to enjoy using the app. It was great connecting with friends and family but recent changes to the privacy policy has left me with serious concerns. It is invasive to have access to all the information on my phone, including my contacts, having the ability to activate my camera without my knowledge or consent, and use my microphone to listen in on my personal conversations at your free will. There is more to it but you get the point. Not cool Insta ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your personal data is worth money. Boo to insta, just one tentacle of Facebook. Nothing innovative here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the intrusion. Instagram, Facebook & now Tiktok all collect your personal information from your devices the second you start using their app. It states this in their privacy policies. All other apps request tracking but give you the option to denims them that ability. Well not Facebook, Instagram, or Tiktok. Nope, these apps only allow you to use their apps if you submit to their need to have access to your private texts, contacts, emails, payment/cc information, and more. Well, I for one will not support an app like that, and Im surprised Apple allows it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram no wants to track everything. Just read the app privacy. They want access to everything on your phone. This is 1984, zuck wants all your data. These people are sick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Me personally, I do not like that you can collect our call logs and metadata history. I do not like the fact that you can see what we do through our camera. Thats an invasion of privacy. I understand making suggestions based on search history throughout the app, but this is going too far. Research for innovative good? Or do you mean your interpretation of innovative good. You can still do research and collect information without being so invasive. If I look for a job on google I dont need you suggesting adds on Instagram that dont work. If I look for an apartment on a completely different separate app, I do not need you suggesting anything for me. I used a different app for a reason. I get tired of seeing the same things on Instagram. I dont need you controlling what I view or limiting what I view. As well as being able to disable somebodys account because your guidelines are too strict and sensitive. Theres no reason to delete nude photos. For example if a woman wants to post a nude photo of her breast to spread awareness of breast cancer why delete the photo when you can sensor it and say its sensitive content. I get deleting photos because the content might be explicit, but if its for a good cause and not the wrong reason then be lenient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not safe for you data. They steal everything and sell your information to third parties. Not safe and disgusting our government allows this. I suggest everyone delete FB, Instagram and Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recent policies. In regards to instagrams recent change in their terms and services, it gives them the ability to do whatever they want with your information, since the new terms are so loose. (Call logs, SMS history, Live camera analysis, address book etc.) You have no rights or privacy under this platform, you are being sold. Disgusting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not let this app track you. Instagram and Facebook are threatening to charge users if we dont give them access to OUR personal data that they sell off to other companies to make money. They should be paying us for our personal data that they profit from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy. They steal your data, they spy on you, they listen on you and they dont care about your opinion.Speak about something then few seconds later you will find ads about it on Instagram and Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So much for privacy. I loved Instagram pretty much up until it was bought out by Facebook. Since then its gone completely downhill between censorship and the new privacy policies. Instagram I do not consent to you data mining my texts, calls, contacts, emails, etc and using my cameras to see where I am, how Im reacting to content, etc. and selling that information to your business partners. The app has been deleted and while I will miss the platform because it was truly a favorite way to connect with ppl I care more about my personal information. Whats that saying, when something is free that means your the product for sale?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sneaky privacy breach by Facebook and Instagram. Could you go ahead and clarify what other data means on the App Store privacy section  section? Other data could mean anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NO Privacy. Every other app has upgraded to not having access to all of our photos because of the severe data you extract to my phones without our knowledge. Like every other app. SELECTED PHOTOS SHOULD BE MANDATORY- Why would I give you access to videos and photos prior to downloading the app that I do not want on Instagram. Why do you need access to that information?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok social media app. This is a cool app for sharing pictures, video, trending topics, and hashtags. But a little sensitive and will penalize you for not knowing about policies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New policy changes. I used to absolutely love Instagram. I love pictures and getting to see so many artistic eyes, being able to see all different sides and viewpoints of different people and walks of life. However, now because Instagram has decided it is ok for a social media app to integrate into every aspect of your phone/life and technology (ex: watching facial expressions, tracking your website history, your photos, gps, places you frequent, contact list, text messages, etc.) I now do not trust this app or its makers in the slightest. Not to mention the amount of censorship has become INSANE People should be able to have their disagreements and have open dialogue and conversation, the makers of this app however only want 1 agenda and side to be shown. This goes against everything human beings should be. Disgusting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero Privacy :(. This app tracks everything about you and then sells that data to advertisers and whoever else they want - you have no control over your live with Instagram/Facebook/Whataapp installed in your phone :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharing private data. Instagram is violating the privacy of people and keep changing the rules. Very shady practices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram sharing your info. Deleted because the new policy gives them access to both ur contact and text messages.  Super overreach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bias. As an entity of Facebook, user privacy is not a priority.  More importantly, censorship is a major issue that Facebook and the wholly owned Instagram entity supports. This has and will continue to be implemented through their flawed algorithm. Users of this application need to be fully aware of what is occurring and ask themselves is it right to continue to support this ideology by using this application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Private info. Its absolutely disgusting that you think you have the right to have access to our phone books, private texts and even see via our camera and what we post on OTHER sites. You have Facebook are the example of what it looks like when COMMUNISM begins to take over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Nightmare. Just look at the App Privacy label. Facebook bought Instagram and turned it into a machine that collects and and sells your data. Dump it and find a social app with a clean privacy label.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last Straw. Instagram is my last form of social media- its value is debatable.  It&#39;s owned by Facebook, has its users posts throttled by algorithms, and pixelates higher definition photos down tolesser quality to conserve space on the soon to be multi trillion dollar 5g network.This should give you an idea of their ethics and whether or not you should continue to support them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, stealing private information. This social media is not only addictive it is very dangerous for each users mental health this is because it shows you things that it thinks you want to see, so you scroll and scroll and scroll, when in actual fact you are just seeing the best bits of other peoples lives, therefore when comparing your own life with theirs yours seems somehow empty. Not only this the app makes you agree to an illegal terms of use that states you cannot clear the cashe, meaning that if you want to delete the data its collected on you, you the user, cannot delete the data. Also rated highest amount of bullying on this app Parents be wary.Not only this but there is a new algorithm that will shadow ban you, if you get shadow banned, its usually because your viewers werent liking your material but if you start bringing out good likeable material then you will get less likes.On top of this you cant control who you follow, what I mean by this is once you started following people, if you want to unfollow a large amount of people say, 300, you will have to do it in small increments of 50 each day and if you do more than  this, your account will be restricted. What being restricted means is that you are unable to: like, comment, follow and unfollow anyone for about 10 days. This is so screwed up because it can happen to anyone unknowingly. Instagram turned to a bad company as soon as it got into the hands of Facebook. DO NOT DOWNLOADVery biased, very unfair, very dangerous, keep away from children",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know what it is. Facebooks instagram. You get what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IG collecting bio-data. Ive had Instagram for 8 years. About a month ago I started to get requests for video selfies. Its a frustrating process where you have to turn your head slowly in numerous directions. Its used in collecting bio data. There is a good chance IG is targeting individuals with conservative politics. This is both dangerous & illegal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This means yall still get information of us while we are not in the app?. As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data censorship. Instagram promotes censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU WANT PRIVACY. They have created a new data policy basically saying they can do whatever they want with your information. They can access your contacts, camera, etc. do not get this if you want your information private.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IG the new facebook. 1. The algorithm2. New terms of use3. Why do you need my photos?4. Why do you need my call logs?5. Why do you meed to analyze my camera?6. Why do you need access to my contacts?7. WHY CANT INSTAGRAM BE FUN ANYMORE?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to Give up your privacy. Government controlled social media platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram is shady. Instagrams new privacy policies allow for spying through your camera at any time. They collect and sell your information. They censor covid information that is not from the cdc. So basically all credible information or new ideas are censored and what is allowed to become trending is cdc information only. The cdc is very deceiving and provides very little data to back up its claims. Social media also banned information about the lab leak theory for a year until it turned out to be true. If it were not for censorship, we could have gotten to the bottom of this much faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excessive data usage and privacy issues. Instagram videos constantly play even though I have limit data usage turned on. It doesnt have a way to turn off videos from playing ever. Facebook owner doesnt care about excessive data usage and collection. Facebook and Instagram use the microphone and camera to monitor users all the time to serve up adds and collect data about you. Apple wake up. How come I cant turn off the GPS in the privacy settings. Guess Apple needs to spy on you too using Facebook/Instagram app software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Media/ Information bias. Instagram block information/ videos etc that share the truth and therefore are bias and selective of what is allowed to be shared.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. It is my belief that Instagram and Facebook exploit user data by allowing certain celebrity individuals to access and profit from unique identifiers and authentic artistic and creative posts. Individuals such as Paris Hilton and Brad Pitt whom potentially manipulate others creativity such as Unique Sounds  and Animations into their DJ staging and Background Props.  I think Social Media is a giant Data Farming Cesspool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont Use This App. May I repeat, DONT use this app Instagram is NOT a free service, YOU and your personal data are the product, not the customer. I used and loved instagram for a long time despite how many times Facebook was caught leaking or selling user data in sketchy ways. But every new feature demands you approve the usage of more data from your device, (contacts, location, etc.) and now they are demanding facial videos from some users to use their service. The Facebook company has already shown that it will choose sides and take in appropriate action culturally and politically and it is getting to the point that users have good grounds to feel unsafe or silenced should they disagree with the Facebook corporation on any big topic. This is absolutely concerning and should not be stood for. Use a social media platform with some respect for you, please.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and information control at its finest. IG and FB and Google interloping to maintain control of media information and information flow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too many regulations. Instagrams blocks and hides any content they deem inappropriate just because someone got their panties in a bunch and reported it. They fact check memes (which are intentionally wrong in order to be funny, like learn to take a joke), they delete content the second someone reports it, and they hide content from people so that you have to physically search for it. I use this app every day and Im getting tired of these regulations. Probably the result of some white suburban mom complaining that her son is being mindcontrolled by social media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Connected to Facebook. Facebook is complicit in crimes against humanity by censoring truth. Instagram is involved in child trafficking and porn. Theyre using your data to their own benefit and malicious intent. Protect your brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Media Sensoring. I dont appreciate it when social media sensors what they determine to be true and factual.  I think I am smart enough to figure that out myself.  As soon as there is an unbiased social media source I will drop You Tube, Face Book and Instagram like a hot potato.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Facebook is terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terms of use . Its disgusting what these people get away with. If you use Instagram you have agreed to allow the application have access to other applications on your phone that are completely unnecessary for Instagram other than them collecting your private information so they can continue to exploit for profit with your personal information. JUST READ THE RECENT TERMS OF USE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Avoid. Owned by Facebook who have zero ethics, are against free speech, and are happy to use your data for their gain. They also track you across the internet and censor anything they disagree with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook buys Insta. No more personalized feed from the people you follow, just mostly ads and suggested pages. Commercialized. Very poor, Im sure everyone will move away from this to a new platform and Facebook will try to buy that up and change it all once people appreciate it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Run by Facebook, Instagram censors political content to meet their own positions and promote their agendas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New terms of service. The most recent tos update has allowed Instagram to access all of your personal data on whatever device you use it on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Privacy Policy is Criminally Invasive. Instagrams privacy policy is atrocious. Im deleting the app after reading how Instagram accesses everything from my phone. Truly appalling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. The number of things that Instagram tracks about you and is linked to you personally is horrific.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data sharing. How come other apps have the information like who is seeing their account, how many followers they have, who has unfriend or block the user.Please clarify this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good but. I like the app and I enjoy looking at dogswhat I dont like however, is the amount of my private data that is taken..facial recognition?? Sensitive information?? Why does Facebook need all of this. Is there anything that we actually get to keep???",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10/10. Do NOT start using this socialistic platform if you dont have it already. Instagram:Facebook INC. has gross overstep and oversight on content shared and disabling pages with scientifically based (peer reviewed) pages because it interferes with the socialist agenda. They politicize all things, allow human trafficking, and empower pedophiles to groom all pages. If a social media platform has the ability to filter all things with key phrases and label them as false information, they have the ability to stop human trafficking, sex slaves, and pedophiles from creating accounts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship = We Know Whats Best For You. Censorship exists to social engineer you to believe certain points of view and limit others. Big tech is not your friend. Facebook and Instagram are manipulating you by offering platforms to share information and track your movements. You are not purchasing a product, you are the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too invasive. Instagram should not be allowed to access my information on my personal phone through their app. This updated terms of service gives way too much ability for the app to get into everyones personal stuff on their phone. This app does not need to know about anyones personal information, other than what they post on the app. This terms of service should be changed immediately",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Now that Facebook has owned Instagram for a period of time, they believe they can censor information that doesnt fit their agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Now that Facebook has owned Instagram for a period of time, they believe they can censor information that doesnt fit their agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Content. They restrict how many posts you can like per day and also they allow racist videos to be on their app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. It&#39;s a good app but I don&#39;t like privacy policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing but censorship. Instagram is just a extension of the Facebook censorship. They are destroying the 1st amendment. The we remove you for sharing facts, real documented facts that are easily verified. Dont support this platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. Some things are in your face about certain information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just curious. Ive requested my data for Instagram and never got it what now????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and deplatforming. Instagram and Facebook continue to spread false information and censor the truth about the media, and politics just to push an agenda. Its sickening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We want our privacy. Dont like how our personal information is shared,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Violation of privacy. Was willing to put up with the already invasive terms of service because I enjoyed the app, but this new update to the terms of service crossed the line. So I am deleting the app. The new terms of service which you automatically agree to by continuing to use it (which is stated in the term) gives them permission to have access to all information in all apps AND all computers you connect with wirelessly. Thats literally everything. Banking, medical, passwords, photos, text messages. The terms also say they can access your camera with no limitation related to just using Instagram. Where it states what they will use our information for it gives the vaguest garbage about enhancing well-being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monopoly. It doesnt matter what I write bc you HAVE to use Facebook and Instagram - their monopoly in the industry is uncontested. In my opinion its time for the govt to intervene in all these big tech giants. I am locked out of my Instagram with no way of getting back in because I never receive a confirmation text.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whats with all the tracking?. i really dont appreciate how instagram has access to my device and what i do on my device, as well as my GPS location. how is that allowed??? #stopzuckerburg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRIVACY. instagram owned by facebook &amp; partnership with google are two parent companies that sell your info &amp; track your every living breath.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dictatorship and censorship. Silencing, censoring, shadow-banning and removing accounts that offer alternative views to the mainstream narrative is evil and outright dangerous. Big tech should never have the right to decide what information gets shared. I, along with millions of others, do not support what Instagram is doing and it needs to be held accountable for its appalling actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Owned by Facebook. Too many ads; around 25% of posts in my feed are ads. Dont trust it even with my camera and mic permissions disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Thank goodness for Apples new privacy tags. WHY do you need access to our health and fitness information under advertising tag? Not to mention other private information that you dont need? This is all so scary :O,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook owned/censored agenda. The app pushes its political agendas by discretely censoring content that they are apposed to. The Facebook owned app will often discriminately endorse other content that fits Facebooks agenda. Both Instagram and Facebook are known powerhouses for many in regards to social media, just be aware of the information you give, as well as the filtered information you receive.      In my opinion, I feel both companies have caused a lot of upheaval in our society and I have deleted my accounts as a result. I encourage others to do the same, you will be more productive and focused on life, rather than obsessing over likes and affirmation from strangers that you dont even know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concerns. The new terms and conditions are so scary. I encourage you to read and research them for yourself. There has to be a different social media platform we can use that operates ethically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data privacy cost just too high. Good social platform ruined by too much data collection from my phone. Good bye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is an evil corporation that sells your data and doesnt care about you. As above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Instagram picks and chooses our freedoms of speech. It decides what we can stand up for, what we can defend, what we ca support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great Source For Information and Entertainment. Instagram is a great platform for news, information, politics, and entertainment. There is something for everyone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terms and Conidtions. I dont like the fact that they collect all data. Sometimes theres just things that you wanna remain private which concerns me. Consumers are just helpless because we cant do anything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasion of privacy. Instagram used to be great. But NOW they changed there policies and can spy on your texts and link to other devices, connect to your camera and a whole lot more. My whole family has deleted this app and Facebook until these companies get it together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Media of all medias . Thats the app social media we know  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Privacy Policy is Criminally Invasive. Instagrams privacy policy is atrocious. Im deleting the app after reading how Instagram accesses everything from my phone. Truly appalling And Instagram banned Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Im finished. Delete the app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tracking your every move. Instagram continues to push harder to track your every move and take away more of your privacy little by little. Instagrams new terms and conditions mean it can use your camera and phone speaker when ever it wants even while not using the app. Instagram can also gain access to all of your text messages and contacts meaning nothing is private. This is only the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADs. I dont like how I talk about something with my friends and that same thing pops up on my feed. Its like instagram listens to my conversations and is an invasion on my personal privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social App using photos. Basically Facebook but less about your bio etc more just about photos you post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abuse. Now instagram want to see and control all your information for example all your conversations they will see and stalking on you and all pictures they can see when you send it to someone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They own everything:. If you havent looked through the privacy policy, make sure you do. They own you email, phone number, sexuality, children, location, data, ethnicity, religion. And any photos or videos you post are now theirs. If you posted a picture of you child or dog, they now own that picture. If a data-collector or someone/ business wanted that picture, they could pay Instagram for it. Does that seem fair? I think not. Change this and dont use Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Deleted because according to the new Terms and service Instagram has access to your SMS message history, contacts on your phone, camera, and DMs. Over all I dont like the new privacy stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uses your facial looks and sells it to other large companies. When you use a filter or take a selfie. Instagram uses a computer to detail everything about ur face. And sells ur face features and other things to other privately owned companys. Facebook too dont forget about clapchat I mean Snapchat ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much algorithm influence. Bring back the chronological order for our feeds. There is no rhyme or reason to how the feed is displayed now. It makes more difficult to stay in touch with people you actually know and for small businesses it makes it nearly impossible to stay relevant with their base. What is with social media companies (Facebook and Instagram) thinking that we need algorithms to show us content that match your interests? Do you think your users are so incapable of finding profiles they like? Wasnt the point of social media to keep in touch with people you know or the profiles you follow? The new suggested profile feature is garbage. Let us stay in touch with the people and profiles we want, if we have an interest we can look for a profile that matches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasive policies. Instagrams policies of surveiling their users to an unnecessary degree, with the goal of developing deeper understanding of the way they think, has scared me away from ever re-downloading. Its a sucky, and scary experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything. Instagram has been a vital component to my business, it has changed the outcome of our business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy?. I have noticed there has been a new update, and some of the features are taking away our privacy. For instance they are allowing them selves to look through our camera roll track our search history and look through our camera roll, all without our knowledge. This is not okay Instagram, you are invading our privacy and by doing that you are not obeying Americas fourth amendment (the act of privacy)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Im not happy with instagrams invasions of our privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. In America we have free speech. Instagram and Facebook are infringing on our freedom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insta whatever. What do you want from anything connected to Facebook. They will be broken up along with the other monopolies. They do not listen to or engage with customers. Its a shame that Instagram is owned by Facebook. But? If people like the model, another company will come along and duplicate the best parts and leave the rest in the bin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data aggregator. Holy crap look at all the data this company collects without your knowledge. I would avoid downloading this app. Why do you need health and fitness, financial, physical address, along with other data pieces? Someone needs to open a class action law suit against these guys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensoring real information. Instagram is for expressing yourself your beliefs and anything you like. Stop sensoring real information. My views since I started posting some real information for the world to see has dramatically dropped. This is not ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political Goals. Instagram and Facebook block content to support their political goals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sell yourself. Instagram was created using Facebook template of information gathering. Want to give your personal information to countries and companies to be used against you.Remember you are the product they make money from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much privacy breaches and they know it . Removed my Facebook a couple years ago for this exact issues. Allow the user control of their data, magic word being privacy, have more control of accounts deleting it, 3rd party ads and apps, always running to see what websites you use what ads you click on no matter the app. Too much infringements on privacy and rather then take responsibility it chooses to avoid legislation by knowing the politicians and government entities are too slow and ignorant to act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app acts like a spyware. Instagram used to be a great app before it was bought off by Facebook. If you didnt know this by now, FBs new term of service allow them to spy on you. They can see what youre doing thru your camera, see your searches, have access to your other accounts like email, bank account, etc. Heres the question, why does a social media app like this need access to all thise things that 1984 big brother needed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They take way more info than you think. Other than the spying policies its a great app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Corruption and Abuse of Trust and Privacy Rights. I am deleting both my Instagram and Facebook accounts. The new terms of service released by this company are offensive and inappropriate. I do not give instagram the permission to:- copy all my texts- copy all my contacts- track my movement everywhere throughout the internet- know my exact geographic location - use my camera without my knowledgeAnd so many other disrespectful, intrusive and otherwise immoral and un-American terms of service.

"Privacy. App heavily restricts freedom of speech also they gather your information while you use the app and when you dont....if you share your contacts, microphone or camera they save the information and store it so they can build a report/file on you so they can market you consumer goods thats why if you say something like  wow nice car and then you get advertisements for a dealership its because they listen to your microphone also they state this in their privacy policy but its very difficult to decipher BE VERY CAREFUL THEY GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE Also they have no care for the 1st amendment they also change your feed to change your thinking PARLER IS A MUCH SAFER OPTION",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Terms and conditions. Yall are taking away our privacy and thats so weird, like y would yall wanna watch us thru our camera, and listen to us thru the microphone, if you agree to the  terms and conditions it basically gives them access to your whole phone( Every picture you have ever saved to camera roll they now have rather you deleted or not, they can also see what ur doing off of the app as well, like what you search,etc). Not only is that illegal but it is disgusting to think that someone is probably watching you when all you wanna do is look at your feed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Feed. As I dont use Facebook I used Instagram to look at friends and families pictures. However, I know just see what to follow and  not my friends pictures....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fact checkers. The fact checkers have no citations or sources of information. it is against my freedom of speech to censor my posts. it is against my privacy to look at posts of mine that are not public. Instagram allows the censoring of the freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The regulations are bordering unconstitutional. Lots of the pages Im following are being suppressed by Instagram. Like they are trying to stifle the freedom of speech. They can say its their platform so they can regulate what they want. It doesnt work that way, but they are going to ignore this.I just want to put my thoughts out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram supports genocide. Facebook supports genocides, the media wont share the truth about the genocide happening to the Palestinian people. Facebook supports the Israelis genocide of the Palestinians. They are censoring peoples videos and images to not show to the world the truth. They are deactivating peoples accounts, they are supporting the genocide. They are controlling the people and freedom of speech. Learn the truth about Facebook Give them 1* rating Fix up Facebook.#FreePalestine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing info. This might sound Karen like but this is no joke Instagram recently updated their terms and conditions and others another working with the government, they can see you and listen to you and everything you say, this is no joke even though it might seem silly, theres been multiple times other apps of done this and all you have to do is turn off your location photos microphone and camera and contacts, if your private person like I am you wanna do all of that stuff so you can stay safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dark side of FB is out. If you want to be spied on, tracked, your browsing data and location data tracked, this is the app for you. There are numerous write-ups on Facebooks awful practice of the information they collect. It outweighs the benefits of this app. Or the data breach they failed to report early, theyve done nothing about it and failed to tell users involved, you literally have to use a third party app to know if your data was breached. Facebook is not and never will be on your side. And dont even make me start on its bias towards conservatives, and threats to deplatform legitimate and factual information. In many instances they do the right thing with fact checking, but they take that power beyond its original intent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Too much algorithm influence. What is with social media companies (Facebook and Instagram) thinking that we need algorithms to show us content that match your interests? Do you think your users are so incapable of finding profiles they like? Wasnt the point of social media to keep in touch with people you know or the profiles you follow? The new suggested profile feature is garbage. Let us stay in touch with the people and profiles we want, if we have an interest we can look for a profile that matches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Algorithm | Advertisements | Fact-Checking |. Algorithm: Ive used Instagram for years and the app is no longer what it used to be. The algorithms are horrible and the post are not in chronological order making it harder to keep up with your friends. Since, your friends recent post tend to be hidden away by a sea of posts that are a couple of days old. Many people try to bypass this horrible algorithm by sharing their post to their stories or asking their friends to turn on their post notifications but the redundancy is tedious. It is most likely intentional in design since it encourages user activity but it is not a pleasant experience for the user. Advertisements: Instagram has some great pages but the advertisements on some pages are too sexually explicit (Especially for the meme pages) which can be problematic. You can be scrolling through your Instagram newsfeed while in public looking at wholesome content or memes and suddenly come across a picture of a nearly naked woman. This can cause your friends and family to think that you are sexually deprived, desperate, or plain creepy due to the fact that they think you are looking up naked woman in a public setting. Fact-Checking: I recommend you watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix to better understand this section. A quick synopsis of the film would illustrate how Social Media companies want to influence your behavior and thought process by at least 1%. Instagram is nefarious for its biased fact-checking which can lead one to assume that they are pushing a narrative. Conservative accounts are drastically more likely to get fact-checked than are liberal accounts when the contents of the post have been proven to be false. I have followed all types of political accounts and I have personally witnessed how some conservative accounts have even gotten fact checked with irrelevant information to the post that was intended to get fact-checked. I would personally like it more if the all political sides were neutrally fact-checked. I do understand that organizations have the right to have their own interest but thats just my take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Violating your privacy. Instagram is now collecting information from all apps in your phone including banking apps. It also is collecting information from your microphones and video camera. Very scary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ive been using Instagram for years now but. Ive been using Instagram for years now and Ive always found it super appealing, my favorite out of all the social media Ive had. I like how its set up, and I have no problems with the over all performance. In any case the only thing I dislike about it is the video-call lay out simply because its not the most visually appealing, but thats never been an actual issue for me. However, these past 2 years its been getting really annoying. Ive had to change my password about 3 times because of claims that Ive connected my account to a like/follow gaining app. This is something I truly didnt do. Even if someone wouldve somehow done it without my knowledge, changing my password this many times shouldve been enough for that to not be the case any longer right? But thats not really where it ends. They dont exactly have any type of customer support and in their help page theres nothing that gives any type of solution to the problems Ive been having. Another thing is the norms and regulations. The idea of it is great, but it doesnt exactly work. My account has been blocked or restricted so many times at this point I might as well not use it. And youd think Im doing something super harmful or insensitive to other people or something, but thats genuinely not the case. I barely post anything on either of my accounts and when I do its either my pets or pictures of special occasions. I dont comment on posts and the things I like or share on my story arent things that are offensive to anyone because I make sure Im being sensitive even with the likes I give. Yet somehow they claim I am violating their regulations and my account is blocked to protect the community but I never know what they actually claim Im doing wrong. This makes it really annoying and at this point I have an account I gave up on using because Im tired of changing the password and another one that keeps getting restricted for no reason at all. Now, Im not just angry about them doing this to my accounts, but what truly sets me off is the fact that a friend of mine reported child pornography and Instagram responded by saying it didnt violate any regulations. How is it that theres pages getting reported for child pornography, exploitation, racism, bashing LGBTQ+ and they dont violate regulations but other people get notifications of them violating policies for things they havent even done? This is not something that has only happened to me but that my friends have experienced too so its an ongoing thing and Im sure theres more people that have experienced this. Its really a shame because this is not a bad app but this issue isnt being handled well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased content censoring. Biased, does not respect others except if they are on the same page with Instagram. Using classification algorithms to strip people the power of showing the truth. In general, social media apps are best used for cooking and shopping thats about it. Not an actual social injustice presentation platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too invasive. I dont want Instagram and its affiliates automatically having settings  which make it too easy to give/receive too much of my personal information. I Wish those settings were more easily on the side of my privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop monitoring peoples lives. Instagram, Facebook and other apps should be a way for people to be entertained not worry about what information is being stolen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased Censorship. Instagram &amp; Facebook use to be a platform for people to share their stories and identity. Now we have fake fact checkers and censorship base on biased political views. Its not the platform that represents America anymore. Freedom of speech and press is disappearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Massive data scraper. This application will grab all data you may unknowingly give. The data will then be used to bombard advertisements on you. Little known data that may be used is metadata. Every time you upload a photo the data will be sold to advertisers. Lets work together and force Instagram to reduce the data taken. For every photo you upload remove all metadata. For every advertisement block and hide the ad. Make sure tracking is turned off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apalling. Until IG comes clean about their use of private data and their political agendas people shud probably stop  using it- i no longer trust IG to do the right thing and wud not recommend it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No Likes, No tags, No Content, NOTHING. Honestly we have been contacting Instagram Facebook help services and no one got back to us. We reported someone for using our content and was banned from all us of the Subject...We have invested a lot of money to get our instant photos custom made based on our logo.We used a marketing company. Thats it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook does not care about you. They do not care about your content. They do not care about your followers or who you follow. They do not care about what you want to see. They do not care about your diminishing reach. They do not care that you want a chronological feed. They do not care that you know their ever evolving algorithm is designed to hide you. They do not care that seeing all of your hard work go ignored due to that algorithm is affecting your mental health. They do not care about your mental health at all, for that matter, and any change to that end is strictly for their public image.Facebook cares about ad revenue. Facebook cares about monopoly. Facebook cares about keeping your time in their apps as high as possible. Facebook cares about your information, in the exact sense that it can be sold. Facebook cares about your emotions, in the exact sense that they translate to engagement and ad impressions. Facebook cares about money, and that is all you are to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much censoring and social manipulation. Since governments have taken a tighter hold on what information is or is not allowed to be shared Facebook and Instagram have become very toxic places. The level of social manipulation is scary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. No freedom of speech. Does not work. Censoring is so high I can barely flip my phone without having to jump over Instagrams information barriers. This is looking more like a government controlled app everyday. There is no privacy or freedom of speech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chill with the tracking. I get its the business model but Insta. Namely Facebook has pushed the gas here and has shot beyond ethics and future legality of this practice. Could be a way more enjoyable app if the features were built for the users in mind and not the advertisers at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. As long as they allow me to continue my free speech Ill use Instagram. I ditched Facebook because they want to censor everything or fact check. So as long as they leave me be Ill use this medium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ads and no respect for privacy. Just read the app privacy labels, its disgusting. No respect for privacy whatsoever. Ever since Facebook bought Instagram, it went downhill. Facebook is evil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deletes accounts. Instagram deletes accounts it doesnt agree with. Freedom of speach is gone from big tech. If you didnt already know. You cant talk about certain things that go against their one sided agenda. Globalist socialist companyprobably because Facebook also owns it. Facebook was a cute and clever way for the government to get all of our private info and they have succeeded. Now they are power hungry helping to pay people to rig an election to favor their biased political candidate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new terms of service are absolutely appalling. Instagram updated its terms of service that basically allows it to draw information from every part of your phone. Text messages, call logs, tracking your face through the camera, access to devices on your wireless service, accounts on your device (loosely defined which means it could be bank info, credit card account info, etc). Big tech companies like this need to reel way back on the data their collecting... its appalling. Deleting the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spying Theifs. I have heard news that instagram will now have the ability to go through our devices according to the new terms and conditions and working with the government being able to look and hear us through our mobile devices and see what we are doing and what we have done on the internet. Although this may not be true im playing it safe and deleting the app until i hear and see this isnt true. Be careful for everyone using this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Appalling that Instagram are censoring free speech. I wouldnt even give them one star but there wasnt an option. This app has an agenda or a political motivation. You cannot censor peoples opinions. I am ashamed to use the app now but soon I shall remove myself as this is quite frankly disgusting. Everyone is allowed an opinion regardless of what political or medical stance someone has. That is discrimination and medical discrimination against the people who are entitled to information. Screw big tech and their censorship. They dont care about anyone other then themselves and the elites/globalists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instacensor. Facebooks take over has made Instagram a platform of censorship. They blocked my a count for sharing info and videos that I found in Instagram in the first place. How does that make sense? Metaverse is breaking our laws and rights for freedom of discussion and debate. People are paid to report you, for any comment they find hateful, hate is a human right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This App is Basically Just Spyware. Once you put this app on your phone all your privacy is gone no matter what options you select. Facebook will completely and willfully disregard your desires and track everything you do on your phone and sell your information to their partners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Capitalism ruined Insta. You guys only care about money and selling data. The shopping part was a HUGE mistake on your part. Deleting all facebook related apps once your new privacy policy comes into effect. FACEBOOK MONITORS ALL DEVICES IN YOUR HOME AND SELLS INFO TO PRIVATE OWNERS. Corporate trash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"privacy. instagram please put privacy on my added friends, don&#39;t put them in the order I add them, put privacy on my likes, impossible to use and the stalkers are watching my life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Irina, Holistic Soul. It became visible clear that Instagram is part of conglomerate media and pharmaceutical companies that controls the contents and censors the truth. Its scary and threaten the freedom of speech. Where is the humanity and moral compass? I deleted IG app and will deactivate the account if it doesnt stop censoring the information we need to know. Not only that, its annoying to receive pop up ads - covid fact information or fact tracker on almost every posts via IG, FB and Google, even on every other apps, It must be removed immediately. I no longer trust their source. Information is indeed manipulated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They control the narrative and how you view the world. Social media should be a place where people can express their views and have their friends see those views if they wish to share them. However I have noticed the algorithms in these apps control what you see and how you share things. Of course things such as hate speech should be removed and deleted but I noticed that racial profiling is a thing and the app actively supports the terrorist state of Israel. They do this by ensuring awareness for the Palestinians are filtered out. They remove posts raising awareness and actively hide them too. FREE PALESTINE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. This is a great way to call or text your friends without using data and a great way to share all you photos and videos across the world I really recommend this for every one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1  for new update and new policy. Instagram was once my go to app for all things entertainment but since the new policy update makes it sound like there is no privacy and therefore DELETED.Ill stick to other apps. Goodbye forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selective with posts. Instagram sensors posts that I wanted to share with my followers to promotes their own agendas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. I dont go on any other social media insta is all I need ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Caters to influencers and corporations. This app goes against everything social media should stand for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy Policy isnt private anymore. Umm... whats up with this new privacy policy?? Its not even privacy at this point. You guys are doing entirely too much. You honestly dont need to be on our lives like that. Accessing our cameras and microphones (without being in the app), accessing our search history and data yea its a no for me. Absolutely disgusting. . Do better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook and Instagram are complete trash. If you look at the privacy label, itll scare you away so take a look",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram and Facebook have done a poor job. Instagram and Facebook have done a poor job when is comes to moderating its content.   I get flagged for community guidelines violations for harmless pictures of my cat or motivational memes.  All of my pics that have been flagged and removed would considered safe for all ages and not mean or discouraging to any person or group.  Requests to Facebook and Instagram to resolve have gone unanswered.  Their model is to harvest and sell your data to potential advertisers and have its very users become the product   they sell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy nightmare. Jesus Facebook is a terrible company. Good thing I can disable all the nonsense Instagram asks for. You dont need my search history, you dont need my health and fitness data. Awful company with no morals and ethics. Cant wait for the govt to break up Facebook and make Instagram its own company again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Love the app, but. I love I can use the app to keep track of all my friends and other organizations and bands and people I am interested in. But the sheer amount of data that Facebook rakes in from your device is both unnecessary and intrusive. I really want to keep the app, but I am on the limb as to whether I want to keep it on my device collecting my data. My main concern is the data lost from facebooks data breaches since they clearly cant or dont want to protect their own data and that of their users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Always censoring the truth. Facebook (Instagram owned by it) only wants to show you what THEY want. Whether its about Palestine, CXVID, government, health or any other matter. Its all false-information when it doesnt fit their propaganda. Who are you to judge whats right or wrong??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Allow us to share what we care about. Crazy how Instagram doesnt allow you to share what you care about to raise awareness about issues in terms of social injustice, ethnic cleansing, genocide I would give it 0 zeros if I could. Stop censoring posts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible Updates. Ive been on this app since 2014 and I do not like any of the updates in the last few years, because its turning into Facebook Very few people actually like Facebook at all, and the ones that do constantly complain about how confusing the layout is. Therefore, why turn an actually popular platform into Facebook? We all know Instagram was bought out by Facebook, but whoever is creating the updates is ruining the app and its going to eventually drive people to a better option (just like how, 10+ years ago, everyone fled away from Facebook to Instagram). Specifically, change the bar at the bottom back the way it was (with only a few options, including the likes/activity, explore, and post a photo buttons), stop with the whole shopping and reels stuff, and most importantly, change the system back to showing photos chronologically. That brings me to my next point, which is also related to Facebook. One of the biggest complaints about Facebook is how it has some bizarre system on which posts get cycled through other feeds and which dont? Like how two people could have the same amount of friends, but one persons post gets seen 150 times and the other is seen 3 times, and its all based on activity (liking, commenting, following people, etc)? Well Instagram now has the exact same system. They do NOT show things chronologically like they used to, but randomly pick and choose what to put in your feed, leading to you see posts days or weeks after it was posted (or never seeing it at all) even when you follow the person. Nobody likes this system. If Im following someone, I like their posts, and want to see their post regularly and chronologically in my feed. This leads me to my last point. Every creator who isnt a huge account is absolutely terrified of instagrams shadow banning. I see people post all the time telling others not to like several photos at once and things like that, to try not to get shadow banned. Its the most ridiculous system because it can be triggered by literally anything (you liking too many pictures, following too many people, someone else liking too many of your photos, refreshing your page more than a few times, etc). Worse though, they dont tell you if youve been shadow banned, so you cant report it if they made a mistake or know when it is okay to resume activity. They just stop putting your posts through others feeds for an indefinite amount of time (so you post and get 1-2 likes instead of your normal amount and just have to figure it out, and leave your account alone for a day or two). I know that they do this because they are an incompetent team and terrible at catching bots, but the system is highly discriminatory towards the many smaller accounts (who do these actions in the first place because its the only way to grow and for Instagram to push their posts through others feeds). People end up having to monitor every move as to avoid the shadow ban. Instead they ought to tell you theyve shadow banned you (and for how long), and give you the chance to complete a CAPTCHA to prove youre not a bot, or report the banning as a mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Human  tech support is needed. There needs to be a way for people to contact Instagram and Facebook.  Extremely flawed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spying on users. Has a keylogger and other crap iOS should mandate as illegal. Data collection is out of control, worse every update. Get rid of Facebook for good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Completely biased platform. I was a long time user for years and years but I had my account deleted permanently for posting a video about the Bidens corruption Instagram said I violated there policy. What one is that that policy where if you post the facts they silence you ? Its a shame because if I would have posted I hate trump Id still have my account Pathetic dont worry IG twitter and FB your time is coming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data strip mining and no regard for user privacy. If you use Instagram just know that every inch of your data is being mined so that Facebook can further exploit you. Even if you delete your account, copies are stored on their servers forever. I dont get how this is legal. Trash app. Trash company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. Just a lot of fractions of information. You dont learn detailed knowledge here. But as a way of recreation it is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a data collection app. This app collects the most personal data of any iOS app. It also censors and suppresses certain political topics and posts. Absolutely no support when there are issues with your account - you have to wait weeks. Disgraceful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bias, discrimination, no freedom of speech what so ever. Worst application ever. Every post you see is controlled by Instagram, they filter out content based on political agendas and propagandas. If your opinion is not aligned with their agendas, or who ever is paying them agenda, then your content will be removed/hidden etc. Very manipulative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Dont like to be tracked by IG, FB or WhatsApp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restriction of speech. I used to think social media was the only place where I could voice my opinions freely. It assured me that my voice will be heard. Recently I found out how wrong I was and how they are actually biased. Taking down stories that don&#39;t go according to their beliefs. People are forced to come up with hashtags so they can make people aware on how they are being oppressed. I believe instagram is a platform which definitely gives you a voice and a spotlight but only to those who they consider are right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why does this is app insist it knows what you want/like?. First they force an algorithm on you, and now they clutter your feed with suggested posts. I dont care about what Instagram THINKS I want to see, its so annoying to have a company care more about advertising and collecting information about you to then try and sell you stuff. Let people use it how they want Stop letting celebrities and big brands take over everything, it not always about them. You keep adding all these features that are portrayed as a benefit to users when its not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Update treating us as wallets. Horrible update. I cant see my friends posts and now, shopping being a bigger aspect of Instagram doesnt make it feel like social media- it makes it feel like Instagram is using us as wallets.I understand using social media for business. But making it such a central point not only confuses users but shows where instagrams priorities lie.Ive had my own account locked before because I was using an approved scheduled. Meanwhile, there are people with tons of followers who regularly break the rules- specifically when it comes to indecent exposure to children. Oh, did I mention that? Instagram is for 13 and up. They have no option for +18 content- which they should. On top of that, the algorithm makes it harder for me to see my own friends and the people who I follow. Instead, its constantly sponsored posts or recommended accounts.I constantly am also getting bots trying to get me to follow people who already have a large following. Im pretty sure that is against the rules, but They all continue to do it without repercussions. Again- I got penalized for using an approved scheduler to share my photography and modeling work. Ive always made sure to follow the rules. Others are literally spamming others and creating bots for followers and go without issue. The quality of this app has TANKED. I will absolutely be using it less, and will be converting to using a platform that isnt connected to facebook or Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Breach of privacy. There is no app in this world which will allow users to use the app for free of cost. It comes with a price and if it is free then it is making you pay somehow. Instagram monitors personal emails, tracks locations &amp; messages, phone activities and can see us via camera then shares our data with many organizations outside. I recommend all to save yourself. May this facebook, instagram and whats app suffer billion dollars lawsuit and get banned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Title. Alright. Instagram is great. You can post pictures, message people, pretty much your average social media app. However, I am beyond frustrated with the new protecting policies that are so irritating Like when you comment something that is far from offensive on someone elses post and it says action blocked because they want to protect users. I understand why they created this policy and its a good idea, but its a good idea that definitely needs some improvements. For instance, you can comment something as simple as a single letter and you will get that notification and it is very frustrating The policy is fine it just needs to be improved to work the way it should. Other than that Instagram is a great app that will hopefully fix this issue. Ive sent many reports and I hope you solve this problem very soon. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fact checkers. It has gotten to a point where someone can post a picture of trumps face with no caption and the screen is then spammed with Instagrams fact checker of the election results better yet that fact checker has gotten to the point where people and base a opinion and fact checker tries to fact check it. Its so overwhelming that Im deleting it... I dont care if a lot of people I know use Instagram. Im not dealing with the leaders of Instagrams political agendas and opinions to be forced down my throat Im officially moving on to a different form of social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
show us more detailed insights. i wish i could see WHO saves &amp; sends my photos i have business insights on but i wanna know who exactly is interacting with my content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"metrics. i still dont understand why we dont have who unfollowed, interactions and etc available to us as business page users. instagram has these metrics laying in the cut - but their algorithmic tyranny levels skyrockets when they even think about giving us these insights release the REAL metrics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOOK AT THE:  DATA LINKED TO YOU & DATA USED TO TRACK YOU. Enough said. Dont use this app. In fact dont use any app whose privacy policy allows it to COLLECT and STORE ON THEIR SERVERS essentially all of your personal contacts, photos, videos, addresses, purchases, financial info, location, and potentially even record what youre typing or speaking. Thank you Apple for forcing companies to disclose how they monitor their users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INVASION OF PRIVACY. Instagram listens to everything you say and shortly after you mention something in a conversation over text or in person youll receive an add for it on your feed. Listens and sees literally everything you do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A great concept with major flaws. First of all, theres two very distinct parts of Instagram, the part I love, and the part I hate. I love that I can share things with others, and others can share things with me. I love the message feature, as I can talk to some people that I cant text. However, part of the Insta community is so toxic its unbelievable. I know its not possible to avoid, but I feel like everywhere I turn its just politics and virtue signaling EVERYWHERE. And I know people can say and post about everything they want, its just I feel I cant escape it. But thats not anything for the developers to fix, thats just a problem with the users. However, Im not a fan of the fact that on any post, even loosely related to a topic like COVID-19, for example, theyll give you a little note saying learn more about such and such and thats kind of annoying. Also, I know this is a social media problem at large, but the stupid fact check this claim about ____ is disputed just annoys me. I want to see these posts and make my own decisions about them and  I dont want them pushed down my throat. Also, for the technical side, theres some stuff Id love to see.Multiple places for links in the Bio. I have more than one other media accounts, and Id like to be able to have all of them, or at least just two, in my bio. Also, increasing the character count of the Bio would be great Id love to see maybe 250 characters insteadThats itPeace -Duckie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Truf. I really wish privacy was a thing when it comes to them but when it come to gettin something through the female you want it too, you can always rely on insta and Facebook lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selective. Instagram is selective and it is NOT a free social mediaIt SELLS your private information to other companies too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not for me and my community. Instagram which is part of Facebook has become a toxic social media platform. They started this downhill journey by collecting our personal data and using it for their own agendas and ads and AI behavioural data collection. We the ice tip of that when Apple wanted to change how its users data is collected. FB was not happy about it. They live and breath personal data collection. Instagram and Facebook encourages extremists and extremism by limiting our access to info that doesn&#39;t challenge our opinions but rather push us to the extreme. We saw that clearly during the trump era and we still see it trough white supremacy groups.Instagram and Facebook has showed time and time again a bias when it come to dealing with my fellow Muslim and Arab community. Censoring content thats very relevant to our causes. Their pro-Israeli approach was clear in the event that are happening recently in Palestine and Gaza. Blocking content that show the Israeli gov. War crimes and horror attacks against the Palestinian civilians. Limiting the access to posts and videos about the subject represents limiting  free speech rights. I cant wait for a better alternative app that protects my personal information and opinion and respect free speech rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Discriminatory guidelines. Instagram censors women, sex workers, POCs, plus size people. They have no support team to reach out to when they do so this. They took away the chronological feed, which means you do not see the people you follows posts, so you have to have them shared to peoples stories so you can see them in order, now they are taking away that option aswell. I dont understand how there isnt another photo/video/messaging app that hasnt taken over yet? Because IG does not care about its users and everyone is so over it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dangerous Social Media. Your platform needs to be regulated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spying. Instagram you have to do batter. Your nee terms of use is so vague and its obvious youre just trying to access everything. It is not okay nor ethical that your using or camera without our knowledge of it and analyzing our data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Way to invasive in privacy. This app connects to things it doesnt want you to for example facebook. I had a separate Facebook account I didnt connect to instagram so when someone got into my account and got me banned it went over to my Facebook and now I cant access them all because of a simple mistake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No data privacy. Not a good app, awful service, and an the company is trying to intrude our privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censoring data. Censoring my content was the biggest issue for me. Not allowing my followers to view my feeds and then blocking fellow followers of my who uploaded similar content.This is propaganda, as this platform doesnt share freedom of speech within reason. It is very censored and bias. No illegal or offensive content was being shared. Except exposing the current events overseas about uprooting civilians. Shame on you. I used to love Instagram, but no longer feel that way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much false information being promoted. Until they start taking action to prevent the propagation of lies and false information that is or potentially is hazardous to peoples health, Instagram and Facebook will never receive more then one star from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Photo Sharing App or Online Store.?. Instagram USE to be fun &amp; enjoyable until Facebook bought it &amp; turned it into a marketing project. You cant even see your friends posts anymore because your timeline is bombarded with ads (to NOT secure websites). Pictures are not in chronological order like youd expect them to be &amp; instead they prioritize influencers to the top of your feed. Instagram use to be intimate &amp; all about your friends &amp; family but now it feels like theyre just pushing ANYTHING in your search history to try to get you to buy something. Its such a disgrace what it has become.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It does the things. Most of the basic social media needs are met with instagram -  and lets face it, were here because we didnt need ALL of them but were too needy for none of them. Instagram fills that vain void inside of you that you dont like to admit to needing. Its great. Im a photographer and a chef Yay America",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible. They track and sell your data. Instagram Deletes posts that dont agree with their political views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than the lack of privacy. Instagram is fine. Wish it wasnt linked to fb. And everything else. Fine for the end of the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram. When used properly, this is an amazing social media resource. I am kept up to date with family and friends. I enjoy pictures. Instagram provides that at my fingertips. Efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shady survey. Instagram is conducting some privacy invading surveys without stating why and how they need the data they are asking for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They want absolute power. Even though Instagram/Facebook watches your every move, after years of using their app, they now require a full video face scan to prove youre human. What nonsense. Just weeks before they demanded my phone number. I gave in but then deleted it from my profilebut it appeared later, so clearly deleting does not delete from their data storage. The face mining seems to come at a random time after extended investment in ones account. And there is no way to skip past it. Do it or dont use the app. They say they will delete it after 30 days. Even if they do, with each small submission to their power they break down your will to protect your privacy. Think theres isnt a long-term purpose behind such an unnecessary reason as they improve their technological capabilities? This is a threat to users. Trap and exploit you. What will they demand next? And what will they do with it all?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. For now one star, i hope if facebook or instagram own instagram they would not let anyone sneak into privacy of everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring content regarding human rights. Horrible app. Selective censoring regarding human rights. Instagram policies are racists and xenophobic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Safety and privacy. Instagram has become a very dangerous site to use. Recently, I dealt with a third party data breach and was sent harassing messages by random anonymous accounts. My information was there. My email account was there and was linked to many different accounts for work and schooling. The breach gave someone that email. My phone number was there. The breach gave that. I deleted the account, set up two factor authentication, and made a new one. And once again, theres been a hack. My profile picture was changed to some woman I dont know. The account followed 15 different accounts, none of which are in a language I understand. A different email was attached to this account. A phone number as well. Whoever got into the account got that information. This app is becoming a waste and just an easy way for people to get your information. Instagram is follow its parent, Facebook. Dont use the company unless youre ready to deal with hacks and the risk of losing information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I herd about your guys privacy policy. I dont Agree with yall taking information from our phones to study who we are and what we enjoy in our lives when i am a being of constant change .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Basically Facebook with photos. Data collecting machine owned by Facebook. Deleted both months ago and my quality of life has been greatly improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Holding people accountable. Instagram and Facebook do a horrible job at addressing reports about abusive racist and/or sexist comments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Media Control. Ive noticed that there are a lot of POC who are not being shared and getting the recognition that they deserve, just because theyre different than the society norms. I think its absurd that someone who is not of color can post something and they will have more views, the algorithm has been forced down our throats. White skinned Norms are able to do more on this site. I think its ridiculous the idealism thats being pushed on us. Get it together Instagram. Using the statistical data for what you think who I am based on my skin color does not give you the right to control what I see on this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Community Guidelines. Instagrams Community Guidelines isnt neutral and biased to what goes with thier Managers views and beliefs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleting for censorship. Facebook and Instagram, and all your independent 3rd party fact-checkers (funded by Facebook) Buh-bye, so long and and no thank you for censoring FACTS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. I dont quite like how they handle your privacy, and was a bit difficult to find and review my data and delete my account. At least it worked after looking for 10 minutes of how to. App is ok, as social media goes. Lots of reposted content, a bit buggy at times and I rather just use a alternative but it does its job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"invasive. They have access to your camera, texts, phone calls and so on and can send the data and use it for the &#34;social good&#34;. Even when you are not using the app.Too invasive. No privacy. Deleted. What a disgrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking, tracing censoring and monitoring. Absolutely disgusted in the owner (Mark) for abusing fb and insta. Tracking, monitoring, listening, censoring. Keeping our data and other personal information/details. Ill be deleting my accounts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censors youre feed. Instagram has chosen to censor your info. Its no longer free thinking and freedom of speech. According to Instagram and parent company Facebook, they will tell you what is right and wrong by restricting what you see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About the meta. So by signing into our account.. we can see what people post on Facebook but on Instagram??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extension of Facebooks Agenda. Bots everywhere. Spam accounts penetrating certain pages comment sections. Highly political. No freedom of speech. Women allowed to basically post porn pics. Extension of Facebooks Agenda and Biases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good But Needs Filter Options. Instagram needs to stay out of politics, vaccinations, and medical issues. Its not ethical and should be pushing specific agendas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Allowing drug, sex, and porn to be solicited. Instagram continues to allow drugs, sex, and porn to be solicited on their platform. They will snatch your account down for saying something disrespectful to certain demographics of people and yet let people promote their illegal activities on their accounts through links and other means. Only app worse than Instagram is tiktok. Ive even reported these accounts just to have them tell me it doesnt go against policy. Sounds like bad policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hope apple or government agencies takes action. Instagram does not care about privacy of the users. It forces (tricks) you to give access to camera and microphone even if you want to post a story using your saved videos or photos. Once the access permission is given, it easily makes video calls to the people. It might happen accidentally as a pocket button or when you accidentally touch a wrong button. You might be in the restroom or shower and it calls people randomly. So concerning that such a huge social media company does such tricks. I hope apple or government agencies takes action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So much for your privacy. Read the app privacy policy. Since Facebook took over, its been a nightmare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Owned by compromised Corrupt technocrats. Prepare to be constantly walking on eggshells, see users disappear daily, and flagged until you are deleted for questioning big government. The political bias is completely obvious when using the app, only because of the tech giants financial interests involved with federal government including the CIA, big pharma, billionaire clients who are also involved with government decisions, democratic parties such as the Biden administration. It is a fact that these apps manipulate the perception of human beings and is toxic in nature because that is what makes money, and it keeps an influx of activity on these apps owned by Zuckerberg and other unethical entities. Instagram not only promotes mental illness such as depression but does not support free speech whatsoever, and in that area it allows certain hostile behaviors to continue as long as it fits the narrative (of those bought and owned mainstream media outlets all tied to the same political parties). Its fact checking systems is not based on true facts but deflective gas lighting techniques, I know because I studied psychological manipulation professionally in my career. Not to mention the anonymous accounts who harass you and get away with death threats under the guise of political correctness. Ive never seen so much corruption in my life and its affecting every country at the same time, yet Instagram welcomes the users who praise and worship these selected political parties and proclaims their allegiance to mainstream media. I am truly afraid for the human race at this time, and the future of these worldwide countries who once lived by human rights and fought for freedom which is no more, the future of the human race is slavery and we have these tech giants to thank for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. The censorship of so many posts advocating for the rights of humans around the world is sickening. The fact that accounts have to have a strategy in place to ensure this algorithm doesnt affect them is crazy. Fix up Instagram. Its called freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues. Instagram we&#39;re able to invade and break through private accounts and delete peoples stories. It happened many times with so many people This is a crime peoples private life, accounts, and stories should not be manipulated or invaded by any means For everyone who uses this app please take care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In plain sight now. The terms that are applied as of December 20th are ridiculous. Youre saying that we automatically give out consent by using the app for you to take all the information in our phones including but not limited to: all contacts in the phone, all pictures, search engines, camera access, and email information. In addition to that you censor all things that dont go with big pharma or the great reset. Freedom of speech on Instagram is dead, and the more you silence people the more well keep making our voices heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Tired of the censorship, its obvious who instagram roots for, who they suppress, what their goal is. It was a cool tool in the beginning, but now just like Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Issues. I will never use this app since Facebook owns them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible policy change. The policy has too much access to all my privacy outside of my Instagram. Censoring posts when my profile is already private, going against freedom of speech, and  discriminating sex workers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Stop censorship of peaceful contents.  Free speech for nonviolent contents should be allowed.  Instagram shouldnt take sides and should allow individuals to voice their options.  God bless the USA ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stalking us all. So instagram is now allowed to view us through our cameras and analyze it, records what we talk about, access all of our call log and SMS history. No sir no maam Im deleting my account. As is my entire family deleting their accounts. Will not stand for this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy nightmare. I put Instagram on my phone so that I could look at pictures. I did not want to be any social media drama queen or anything like that. I just want to look at pictures. The next thing I know the app is asking to connect with all my contacts on Facebook, my phone, and who knows what else. I deleted the app immediately before it could ruin my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram silencing users. Instagram and its head are supporting genocide, systematic racism, and oppression of an entire people. Colluding with forces of oppressive regimes, falsely blaming things on technical glitches while spreading lies. Happy Apple is limiting data now with 14.5 release. You guys dont care about local businesses at all, so dont lie about why you need user data. We are not falling for it. Boycott Instagram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. The information censorship not lining up with your agenda is a major problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only works if u want to buy into their agenda. They collect data from you phone (more so than other apps) and then stop you posting what you want if it doesnt agree with their agenda... censorship all by a media platform and just for money .. the more info they have on u the more ads they can sellAlso they use it to support aggressive regimes spy on their ppl Ironic considering the owner of Instagram is the most secretive person... its cuz he knows hes created a monster and what the effect is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insta. This isnt the best social media platform but its one of them The best part of the insta is it knows you and reads you well through the algorithms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Collection App. Mandatory App. Instagram has moved into an area of abuse. Why am I saying this? Their are more profile options on the app, than the web browser. Which means they want you to have the app installed. Why would they care if the app is installed? Traffic. The more you use it, the more they collect, the more they sell. You cant even delete your own posts without the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cohersion. Many of us of find ourselves on instagram because friends, family and news.  What we dont want its to be coerced to download the app and opened an  account when viewing instagram posts. No, you may not have access to all of my private videos and pictures, no you may not keep copies in the cloud, no you may not sell my data. No, I will not not be a Zucker. STOP COERCING, Zuckerberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media is rat poison for democracy. Facebook has turned Instagram into just another propaganda outlet that continues to radicalize the US into two separate enemy states, all while earning billions from the ensuing increase in engagement. Social media is rat poison for American democracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discrimination. Discriminating against freedom of speech and freedom of information is criminal . Instagram should not be involved in politics and controlling point of view . God Bless the world in this time of stripping freedom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sick of no privacy. Wont load my content because I have a vpn on so they cant control my feed. Continually uses its algorithm to push down or delete any right leaning posts Ive interacted acted with on my suggested feed. Im beginning to hate social media it was a place of free thought and speech but continually becoming a place of manipulation and restriction. As humans we are naturally centrists at our core holding both left and right views depending on the issues but time and time again the tech gods are suppressing one view to elevate their own personal leanings. I hate what Instagram has become an opiate for indoctrinated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feedback about policy. THE NEW INSTAGRAM POLICY IS VERY BAD and they block accounts for nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are facebook. Data not safe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So Many Restrictions. Instagram has changed so much since Facebook took over. They have restrictions everywhere they have deemed against community guidelines but allow wealthy and popular users to get away w anything. They have began banning hashtags relating to mental illnessesthe way we get together and find our communitybecause its somehow against community guidelines. IG used to be my favorite and pretty much only social media but now Im seriously contemplating deleting my profile. Do better Instagram. Disgraceful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GREAT SOCIAL MEDIA APP. I use it to promote the things that interests me and follow other people who are passionate about the same things that I love That ranges from food, to fashion, music, to business, humor, to news I find it much more interesting than Facebook or Twitter, because the way the site is set up or put together, I can simply look at a persons content, posts and/or photographs and easily distinguish what theyre all about as a individual, primarily; somewhat, without buying into what they actually state or claim I can VISUALLY, see what theyre about and I like that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other than the surveillance. Of my conversations and the marketing that comes with it. I like Instagram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Use it to gain knowledge and to keep in touch with friends and families. Social media can ruin lives, its easy to waste time in these apps, be careful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wow, they (FB) is tracking EVERYTHING now. Thanks to the Apple new privacy disclosures, I get to see what IG is tracking about me, its mind boggling and disgusting. I wish I can post a screenshot, but please look for yourself, its no longer about contacts and such, theyre tracking your financial information, your health information, your search history, sensitive info (which they dont tell us what), browsing history, and they  admit right there they are tracking you across apps and websites owned by other companies. Disgusting, simply disgusting how theyre profiting from selling our data. I am out, goodbye FB, goodbye Whatsapp, goodbye Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. If you are fighting oppression and believe in human rights, Instagram is not the app for you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom Of Speech. Instagram keeps censoring and banning accounts because of activism. Anytime someone mentions current events such as the Genocide of Palestinians, they suffer consequences. Smh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guidelines. I am unable to tag people on my story when doing so I get a message that talks all about guidelines and stuff... Instagram has been a great app and probably will continue to be for everyone, but I think it has come to an end for me and a few others i know due to this... Instagram is for sharing and having fun, but cannot due that due to the 200 rule for likes, followers and tags ETC... wish it was more then 200.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship Platform. Instagram routinely censors accounts which are pro America. Allows anti American radicals to share anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasion of privacy. Instagram updated their terms and conditions where they actually look through your phone, messages, pictures, sees your history, contact info, and more. This is ridiculous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Muzzling Free Speech. Instagram owned by Facebook has shown its true colors by taking sides in political conflict and gagging free speech using sophisticated algorithms to delete and/or censor free speech. This is unconstitutional under US law and the company should be held accountable. Siding with oppression never pays in the long run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is wrong w you and your new terms of services. Why you need to stalk peoples camera roll instagram?Why you need to know ip addresses  location, contact info, search history, and a lot of private stuffYall were good but this is nonsense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Human rights. Facebook and Instagram have become a forceful platform to drive global narratives which are profit driven and against human rights Censoring peoples freedom of speech is proof that these platforms supports tyranny. The coronavirus pandemic has been introduced to force the great reset which Facebook, Instagram and other global billionaires are eager to implement knowing full well the population of this planet would refuse such controlFacebook and Instagram also supports and promotes experimental medications which contradicts equality lawsThe last thing Ill say on this is how unreliable the fact checking system really is There is no evidence to support theyre telling the truth because the evidence they use is provided by big pharma and other profit making companiesI hope the courts bring you all to justice for crimes against humanity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much privacy breaches. Removed my Facebook a couple years ago for this exact issues. Allow the user control of their data, magic word being privacy, have more control of accounts deleting it, 3rd party ads and apps, always running to see what websites you use what ads you click on no matter the app. Too much infringements on privacy and rather then take responsibility it chooses to avoid legislation by knowing the politicians and government entities are too slow and ignorant to act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook steals data. Instagram steals ur data and sole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensor everything. Watching Instagram and Facebook pick and choose whats to be viewed off of fact is not how the 1st amendment works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Election Information and Leftist Agenda. Instagram just like every other social media platform is providing incorrect election information and banning conservative opinions. Unless the soeaachbis hate speech or threats allow open and fair communication for all people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concerns. Be warned Instagram accesses all your phones data. Listens to your background chat and also analyses your keystrokes for personalised ads. If you care about privacy - this is not it. Do not post your face on this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not the greatest. Since Facebook bought Instagram everything you say or post can now be seen by the government and used for facial recognition. They unsend messaged to your friends if you are sending URLs that relate to the election and etc. I would highly think about what you send and or post.Good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. Some social media apps have to learn that theyre created to give the freedom of speech of people who have no freedom of speech to media if you gonna turn to be just like to control it media then you should not exist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Controlling content gone too far. I used to love a Instagram before we turned into a dictatorship. Today the #sun hashtag is hidden along with save the children, yet you allow degrading hashtags exist. You shut down pages for sharing truth about corruption in this world. Why Instagram? Community guidelines? Who are they really protecting?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Community guidelines. Instagram prevents sharing various posts about A CAUSE OF SPREADING AWARENESS AND HELPING COMMUNITIES under the excuse of it Going AGAINT THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES just because the topic the awareness being raised about is against their agenda.. total disrespect to their users.. a bad app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Getting rather fed up with accounts being censored, and the constant Covid 19 pop up over anything that challenges the narrative. Free speech is extremely important and if Instagram keeps deciding what it will allow me to read, Ill just stop using it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy Issue. This app is extremely intrusive, it is tracking all of activities whenever I am on my phone. It is even manipulating our emotions. A week ago, I lost a family member due to cancer, and when I opened instagram it was showing me posts about people who passed away because of cancer. It was devastating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why is my info being reviewed?. All I do is keep in touch with friends and post cat pictures. Less than 800 followers/following combined. Im not important, just let me have access to my own stuff. I dont have Facebook, this is how I connect",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy, censorship and bias. This is my most used social media app however Ive been noticing that my content has been shadowbanned when I share legitimate and verified information about apartheid and occupation. My story views more than halve. Ive noticed some accounts that share information love from a the ground have also been shut down or silenced/restricted. Im not sure why there is this sort of a bias going on but it delegitimises the app. And lets not even begin to talk about the amount of ads that are are now in the app. Appalling, honestly. Will probably be deleting soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. Its a very useful platform especially if you have a brand your trying to aware the public about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media. Easy to use. Without Instagram, my business wouldnt have survived. Were so lucky to have this platform to share our tea house with people we normally would not have reach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Filters. I never realised how controlled Instagram is until I started posting about Palestine, the amount of posts that got hidden due to propaganda is ridiculous Such a racist app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Terms. Well I liked Instagram because I could connect with friends and family and share photos with others, but these new terms are allowing Instagram to search my phone Yes I did read the new terms and its a complete invasion of my privacy You cannot use Instagram without agreeing to give them access to all your data, not just the things you do on the app while its open. With the new terms of use, Instagram now how access to anything you do outside the app. Access to payment information and contact addresses are accessible if you sync any Facebook/Instagram account to your phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Storage. Why does Instagram occupy so much storage, cant they store our data in their cloud or server.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disabled accounts. Instagram is notorious for disabling accounts even if youre just looking at different stories from different profiles they assume youre stalking Themeven if you change your location youre at your job or had to go overseas on business Instagram security thinks your hacking your own account, if you like too many photos you get a message youre abusing the policy, if you dont post the right photos they dont give you warnings they just shut you down saying youre not following their policies and will disable your account, they are just as bad as Facebook when you sign up and they dont like what you put consider  your account quickly terminated. its like they only want certain people on their platforms its terrible how they treat people, if they dont like you they make up an excuse saying you dont follow their legal terms and disable your account. They dont even give you a warning they just do it anywaySome of us dont even understand what those legal terms even after reading it doesnt make sense, theyre not even specific enough to tell you what youve done wrong ridiculousMaybe improving on a little heads up to a lot of people who have an Instagram profile would helpif someones doing something that violates their policies why not give a pop up warning send an email or send us a direct message to the in box would be fair, People make mistakes all the time why not give people a chance with a little warning if the policies are still being abused after the warning then I can understand disabling the accountsBe more specific regarding the violations people are doing, give people a chance to wrong the right they need to stop discriminating, folks be careful when signing up they pick and choose who they want using their app terrible experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"INSTAGRAM=CENSORSHIP. I would give 0 stars if I could. INSTAGRAM = CENSORSHIP Do not support these evil people controlling what you think and see.  Anything against the mainstream narrative is taken down or deemed false by paid off fact checkers. Its all a joke now, they track everything you do (stated in the new terms and conditions Dec. 20, 2020). You agreed to these by simply using the app. Do not support this app anymore, it used to be innocent and fun now its scary and controlling. Sounds familiar (our government) get ready for the revolution folks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Copyright rules. I understand the need for them with protecting peoples identities but if they didnt want there picture or video reposted they should not have put it on the internet where people share and repost videos all the time . Instagram already steals all our data and sells it to other companies or to the government so theyve already seen what everyone has posted why does it matter if I repost it again Im not hurting anyone I make sure to post mostly family friendly type things Ive never said anything bad on anyone unlike others the account I had was all in making people laugh after a long hard day of working and especially with the pandemic people needed it. The other thing is how did yall have enough time to ban me but when I reported an account for posting explicit pictures yall suddenly dont have enough people to check if its true or not like what  it doesnt make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is an evil company. When you use their products (like Instagram), you support them financially to continue doing their evil things. Just know that next time you want to use one of their products... Also, theres too much explicit content on here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. Instagram as well as FB is biased and if we post anything not in line with their political views they try and hide our posts in order to silence us- we will not be silenced for spreading the obvious crimes against humanity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TOS Violates Privacy and Rights of Users. Instagram changed their TOS (Terms of Service) which never originally included an in perpetuity clause.  Then, they changed their TOS to allow complete and total infringement of privacy and rights.  They do NOT need access to your contacts in your phone address book, they do NOT need access to your medical records, they do NOT need access to your bank account, they do NOT need to tell you what to do about masks (some people have medical conditions preventing them from being able to wear masks), they do NOT need to claim ownership of your name if you create at domain with the same user name as your Instagram account...READ THE TOS PEOPLE  Delete your apps, clear your caches, and STOP using Instagram.  I can only assume Facebook will be next as they own Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used to love it. I used to use Instagram every single day. Until they changed their privacy policy, I see no point in using it. They sell your data to whoever they want and can track you through all the apps you use on your phone. They can see it all. And with that in mind, they lost a user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Way to keep in contact with your friends and to see what is going on. I like it a lot. The DM feature is great. I also like how you can post multiple pictures at once and post things on your story. The only issue I have is how Instagram tracks what you do and recommends posts for you to look at. I would like more individual privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mines your data and still cant show your interests. I have been using Instagram for multiple years. When I look things up on YouTube Instagram knows. They barely tell you that this will happen and downplay the severity of their data mining. And despite all the data mining over multiple years they still cant show things on my explore page that I care about. Instagrams false information detector will target you and hide your posts over stupid things while whole flat earth accounts are allowed to continue. Speech is incredibly censored and it is aimed at the average user rather than entire accounts of false information and baseless claims. Use at your own risk. Instagram works essentially the same way as the Terrence and Philip mobile game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ig is using your personal data and they can see what you are looking at. So ig is ues are personal data and they can see what we are doing so say like if same one is looking up pornography on like Safari and you go on Ig they can see it and use it against you in a court of law and they can go back and look up what you look at that in there new update in the terms of services and the Government can see it too so we dont have privacy anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deleting posts and pictures used for awareness. Its unfair and absolutely unjustified for Instagram to delete posts and pictures that are uploaded for human rights. Stop filtering posts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram censoring at plea of foreign governments. We all know Facebook allowed Russian ads to sway the American public and influence election results. Instagram works with the Israeli government to censor the killing of children, families, doctors, and NGOs by Israel. They are actively blocking voices that are seeing this violence and reporting it or spreading awareness about it. This is against the first amendment and Instagram must be held responsible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spying on users. Found out recently Instagram records people when using their app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram Review. While the platform is fun, I cant seem to get over the fact that what was labeled by this application as miss information, leading to personal and professional accounts being banned, is now acceptable as fact. People lost their accounts because of this big tech miss information campaign. Its obvious now that Instagram, Facebook and the like are being used as a propaganda dispersing tool. Instagram is violating our 1st Amendment Rights folks, this is a big deal. God bless all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Say goodbye to privacy. Facebook is at it again - You essentially have ZERO privacy with Instagrams new horrid terms of service. Read it in detail before installing or continuing to use the app. I will be deleting after I post this review. Additionally, Facebook is continuing to destroy user experience with their horrid feed algorithms. A formerly great social media app ruined. Sad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. This is a very very bad social app and its very selfish by the managers Handel. Its very bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needs an iPad App. Instagram is a great more focused alternative to Facebook without the politics and photos are stored higher quality. Id love it if only it had an iPad app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and Mental health. Censorship has turned both facebook and Instagram into policymakers and dictatorships. Mental health is a huge issue due to the show off and the mania people get about the materialistic stuff that being showed and represented as a sweet thing on the platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram VIOLATES HUMAN SPEECH RIGHTS. Same with Facebook, they violate the laws to the United States freedom of speech speech. They block and delete profiles as they please because they dont like and agree with what you said even if it doesnt violate community standards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much data monitoring. Why do you need access to my camera and microphone to post something to my story thats already on Instagram or in my photos?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too political, advertisement related, and ZERO real privacy. I had to l leave Insta a while back after having been a user since the beginning of Instagram itself because they dont believe in restricting their access to my camera or microphone. When you look at all of who supports mainstream media anymore its just too uncomfortable and fishy that these social media platforms think they need 24/7 access to our devices. Lastly, Im not for sale so the ads are just too much. No one wants to be force fed ads on here, or Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere else for that matter Way to go social platforms, youre constantly driving your users away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporate spying. This company along with face book think they can spy on the American people. They will record your face while using the app and they dont care as long as they can ke you in it long. I am tired of these social media companies trying to take advantage of us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram is censoring freedom of speech. Instagram is controlling what we post because corporations and governments tell it to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ig has to much censorship. It would be better if I could get real facts real news & hear conspiracies if I want to ... Its sad that people cant have their own opinions on Instagram or social media period .... Im deleting .. DONT TRUST IT they will feed anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A selective application. It selects the content that they want to be shared especially when it comes to political cases. Even that there is alot if accounts that should be deactivated because of thier hatful content they just put thier focus to those who dosnt share with them the same beliefs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spy. its illegally that  instagram all the time listen and use  phones camera to collect information and sell them for money, our privacy is matter,  u ridiculous app, its not right way to make money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENSORSHIP. CENSORSHIP is disgusting. The fact that Instagram are censoring accounts that post facts that dont aline with their agenda is outrageous. FREEDOM OF SPEACH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media is a game changer. As someone who relies on different avenues for my business exposure, social media is the most important. None rank higher on my list than Instagram and FB. Great way to reach the masses and interact with potential customers and friends",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Raciest. How is a social media platform that should grant freedom of speech, oppress a community And hides posts that exposes what the owner of Instagram doesnt want to be covered by the media  Happened many times  #saveshaikhjarrah #freeshaikjarrah #stopthewthniccleansingofPalestine ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. This company is owned by Facebook all they do is track your every move. Disgusting lack of privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont bother making an account service, the Instagram Facebook team doesnt care about you. The spirit of instagram is to share photos and connect with your friends and others. Every single update adds a feature from other apps that is unnecessary and clouds up the user interface. The simplicity of the app hot bar has been ruined by adding shop and reels (reels is the same format as TikTok) instead of explore. The notifications and explore page can only be reached from your non-chronological feeds homepage which is inconvenient to use. There is not even a tutorial that opens upon first use of the app post-update that tells you how to use each feature correctly, or where they are. Instagram has been incredibly and increasingly frustrating to use since the Stories update, and it is harder to support small businesses, creators, and even my friends I cant see my friends most recent posts anymore due to the algorithm never showing up recent posts in my feed. I am unhappy with Instagrams userface and lack of integrity toward creating a social media platform that at its heart is to share photos and/or videos via posts with your friends. I will be deleting my account service due to all of the bullcrap a small user like myself has had to put up with. If you are considering making an account service, dont bother. The team doesnt prioritize anything in particular except for stealing social media ideas from other platforms. It all went downhill after the chronological feed feature was removed PERMANENTLY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PRIVACY INVASION. Instagram plans to release a new terms of service where you can be watched at all times from your front camera. They will identify items in the background and sell photos of your face- room- posts- and more to companies trying to take advantage of you. DELETE THIS APP, or say goodbye to your anonymity and safety forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. Data used to track you is so creepy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Take some social responsibility. I dont often write reviews.Im sick of reels clouding up my feed so that I miss my friends and familys posts. And the way this negatively affects my attention span.Im sick of being recommended products or services related to something I talked out loud about 5 minutes ago and somehow the phone picked it up.Yesterday, I posted a picture of myself at the beach with a full sweatshirt and long pants on and sent it to my boyfriend, who liked it. Today, he told me that his explore page is flooded with inappropriate pictures of girls in revealing swimsuits and other crude content. Hes a sweetheart and asked me to try and get rid of the images. If youre into pornography, thats fine. But no one deserves to be shown images of naked body parts without consent. It is our opinion that women cant compete with edited images and conditioning men to be constantly seeing these is only damaging.Furthermore, every time I clicked not interested, and refreshed the page, or reported the posts, even more disturbing images and reels showed up to take its place. Im disappointed. Instagram has always been one of my favorite social media apps before it got so toxic. Please fix these issues - you have the resources to do better, and you have a social obligation to do so. I cant begin to think of the terrible things meta will do to our society once it is released - that is - if people even use it. I was already close to being done with Facebook (I only really use it for groups and selling on marketplace anyway), now Instagram too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used to be cool. Owned by facebook. If youre still on both of them, spend a few minutes on their policy of sharing your information. You have no privacy online with this company that is actively undermining democracy in the world simply because their owners want to get the money hand outs that the poor in the world wont get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insta. Not what it once was. Theres no freedom of speech anymore. Social media  are manipulating every political agenda to suit what ever Agenda they want NowFact checkers fact check you even when it comes from the official government website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extension of Facebooks Agenda. Bots everywhere. Spam accounts penetrating certain pages comment sections. Highly political. No freedom of speech. Women allowed to basically post porn pics. Extension of Facebooks Agenda and Biases. Scam accounts everywhere you look,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Controlled  content. I posted a video that I made on tik tok involving politics and fear mongering media (not out of line at all) 30 minutes later Instagram blocked it. I love Instagram but in reality it controls content that is Against Their political view. It is the sam thing that most social networks do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Photo Quality and Algorithims. If insta about Photos then they should allow better quality video and stories. Also algorithm is stupid I want to see all my friends posts yet some of them its like Im not even following them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Control. Just another form of Facebook nothing but ads Get your information and trying to sell something to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram oh Instagram. Rife with exploitation of its users. I think Instagram and Facebook are great present day examples of how to start with a good business idea and then ruin it over time until it will eventually fail. Just as Facebook though man are on it still feel how much they no longer like it. Etc etc. Instagram has no boundaries anymore. No morality. Artists and creatives, just everyday people made it rich and famous and then the businesses are bought and ruined by big tech and exploitation all for the sake of money. Instagram exploits its audience, disrespects their privacy, disables its viewers from having their own audiences and then continues to further and further tweak the algorithm. Sounds a lot like what Facebook has done and we see how many people left it there, myself included. When will we as a collective humanity say enough. Instead we continue to give and give, forced to reach our own audience by paying for the connection. Its not hard for Instagram to allow everyone to see everyone else, to be easily found. Its that they withhold it now... for money. Every other post is an advert, my own followers cant see me but see random explore images. You cant opt out of anything anymore. Narratives are spoon fed to you, you cant even report ads for the one reason many actually want to hide them: because we didnt ask for them, because Instagram has no boundaries and is that stalker wed all tell our best friend to leave who wont stop clinging and humping your leg. At least its a comfort to know I no longer care if it fails, nor do I have any issues anymore with disengaging from it. Likes dont matter at all to me now, nor do followers and Ive no problem deactivating account indefinitely these days, in fact I think its a good practice to stay sane and shut it off for even a year at a time. The real world is really there, and needs our attention. These apps also have begun massively massively censoring anything or anyone with opinions beyond the accepted narrative. Ive lost all respect for social media platforms. And for all they offered way back when. - friendship with strangers, sharing our art, its just another place now the rich get richer and continue to use their audience for financial gain - and who knows what else. I am certainly theres even more garbage we dont know about. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Make business accounts more detailed. I love instagramI have my account set as a business account so I can see my insights, and I love that feature, the only downside is when I go to look at my insights on a post, I cant see whos saving and sending my posts. Id love if they added a feature where I could see both my activity on my pictures and whos doing what",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram should not have this information. Got an alert from Instagram this morning that said &#34;Tell us about your purchase experience with King Soopers.&#34; The only way they could have this information is if they are using GPS data for targeted advertisements, as I have never used this phone or Instagram/Facebook account for any King Soopers online purchases. Not only do I already have every targeted advertising setting turned off, and I have location access turned off in iOS settings as well, but this advertising tactic is ludicrous. This is not information I want any app to have access to. Mark Zuckerberg does not have permission to see that information about me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restricted Guidelines are a problem. I hate that Facebook bought out Instagram. Its changed way to much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hardly any insights. Facebook, when are you going to keep our insights? If we change our account back to personal, why do we lose all of our insights even if we change it back? Pretty dumb when most of us pay for advertisements, which doesnt even hit the minimum accounts you say it will. If you have a business look elsewhere, and by that I also mean Facebook, because the viewers they say youll hit on there, is even worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politically biased, non-neutral application. Its social media not Tv, when you can allow just what you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram is trash and needs to change. Instagram has invaded our privacy and shadow banned us enough. During a global pandemic and constant political upheaval social media is a platform supporting many peoples livelihoods. We deserve better period. Just like Instagram was created an app that doesnt censor and supports liberation can be created. Change or become obsolete Instagram aka Facebook.  Why did we allow corrupt facebook to buy IG, oh right neoliberalism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politically Biased. I dont really care for politics too much, but when Instagram deletes accounts that endorses the wrong side they will delete it. Or they will simply put the fact checker on a post and say it is false even though there is evidence proving it it true. I have lost all respect for social media at this point and I hope other people do too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible new policies. Instagram is attacking its own creators and now has the ability to sell your photos to tech and AI companies. This isnt okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whoa  Zero privacy with this app. If you look at the privacy section of the Instagram description in the App Store and see all of the personal data that they collect  You will be frightened  Im off Facebook.  Now Im leaving Instagram.  Just gross.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. If you want an app to mislead the public with information then Instagrams the app for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cultural Garbage. The concept of a photo sharing app social network that allows for customization and looks amazing, to boot, 5 STARS. What it has become, a corporate-owned, publicly-traded, privacy-invading, advertising machine filled with narcissism, anger, hate, sex, and probably a lot of memes and pictures of cats/food/feet on sidewalks. The whole concept of a machine that decides what you see based on what it profiles you as liking, is idiotic. My needs change, and my social network does not. Corporate owned. He whole purpose is to generate revenue. And it promises avenue generation to its advertisers because its essentially Amazon now and tracks you to show you what you typically buy so you keep buying it. Privacy invading. Your info is sold. Simple. You have no rights. Posting political stuff? Dont worry, they will throttle those posts and force their own agendas anyways. You have no control. Narcissism. Enough said, its a place for people to show themselves off for the sale of generating attention. Disgusting. A true testament to the condition of the world spiritually. Overall, something cool, kinda like Tumblr used to be. But someone always comes along, buys it, and ruins it. Instagram is the new Myspace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I removed Facebook for this very reason. DO BETTER",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facebook is making 100s of billions of dollars off of this technology.  Wake up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dont uh complain about third parties being able to log in through instagram via a third party when you know that they developed an app for people to check who follows etc for that Ban the access entirely exactly something with sense tho because yall have to know and allow it to be allowing them to continue developing and letting them connect uh if its just to track and to unfollow and unfollow.; The big deals not being understood its quiet concerning , i enjoy facebook for plenty of reasons idk it hardly has issues like with instagram js, embarrassing super annoying at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Californiaplug got deleted. After spending 11 days with my account on activated I am becoming very fed up with Instagrams policies.The first day I spent over an hour and a half reading the IG Rules, what is expected of members and &#34;The Guidelines&#34;.  By my interpretation I could not find where they based a violation in my account. One interesting portion under the About tab explains how sometimes accounts are unactivated on accident by automated programs that search Instagram for violations.  After researching I spent several hours writing a heartfelt letter expressing my remorse for offending them, complementing them on providing a worldwide platform that helps my business to thrive and how I would never risk losing this privilege again.   Six days went by with no response, I then hired legal counsel for advice on how to handle the situation. Both recommended that I reach out one more time and plead to have my account reactivated. A large part of the necessity is not only a web presence that I poured years of my life into but also our contact list which is invaluable and we have no way of retrieving. We have spent countless hours trying to restore this valuable data with no luck. So I reached out to Instagram again, again with no response. Since I have been prejudiced against by IG it makes me stronger and not become complacent in a slave to Instagram or their mother company Facebook. If I don&#39;t receive the common courtesy of an acknowledgment were leaving, wake-up Instagram, can&#39;t you have one of your 5000 programmers write an auto response for your email program? At least people will know that they&#39;ve been acknowledged and action is being taken, &#34;Help Is on the Way&#34;. In lieu of this rude and unsympathetic treatment, I am prepared to take IG out of my Internet marketing diet.  Other platforms are equally as powerful at reaching the worldwide market, and I&#39;m prepared to put my energy in those avenues rather than being mistreated and take it for granted. Instagram Is Controlling, Self-Serving and Is Drunk with Power..... And if they don&#39;t start appreciating their users, they may lose them all as quickly as they got them.Im a clothing brand manufacturer, Ig deleted my business , I didnt violate any terms before my deletion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too many ads from pages and the app. Instagram is now a bot and ad pool. You cant follow a meme page with our getting bombarded with ads. Its the same for every other page and its ads for cheap knock off clothing, womens only fans, cheap items, and ads for meme pages that have more ads for meme pages the all have nothing but ads. This needs to be regulated. I have a meme page ,its small, and I dont post ads because thats what a meme page is supposed to be about and I havent seen a friends post in weeks because of how many ads. I had to make another account to be able to keep up with them outside of there Instagram stories.On top of that you cant speak your mind. It tells you whats ok and not ok to say. Like dude its my social media account if you sensor my opinion because it other people disagree then youre taking a dump on the first amendment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a data mining app that collects information about you stating it is trying to bring you products you may want as an excuse to do so. Have developers and employees really fallen this far to have no morals or respect for individuals? It also seems as if these same individuals are okay with hiding the truth and spreading misinformation aligned perfectly with what liberals and democrats believe in. Quit hiding the truth and spreading lies. This social media platform has fallen far and continues to fail. Dont forget where you came from, and what country gave you this opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restrictions. Instagram blocks and restricts accounts who speak out against injustice. Shameful IG.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sissy. Last time I checked this was America. This app along with the majority is an infringement on free speech, I understand its a private platform but face book has monopolized the industry of social media which isnt fair. God forbid we go against the guidelines instagram/Facebook has set, because those folks know all. I rarely am fed post in my search feed about what I actually search for its all a bunch of bologna. You people are awful and should be ashamed of yourselves I just want to share pictures with my friends and look and animals and fishing pictures instead my comments are hidden and Im force fed videos of gays lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Newsfeed is AWFUL Resharing stories Bug. Update: its gotten worst. I see 1 business/influencer, 1 ad and youre all caught up I follow maybe 20 celebrities and my entire newsfeed is made up of posts from 10 of those celebrities no matter how old the posts are. I almost never see posts from real people and Ive had to Unfollow pretty much every celebrity to even begin to see real people on my timeline. Using suggested post as the default layout instead of chronological order makes it so that I dont use Instagram much because every time I get on it feels like Im being sold something instead of engaging with people I actually know. Instagram has turned into craigslist and it will go downhill until you start giving people what they want not what you want to sell them. My timeline is 10 posts from 10 celebrities and then it starts with the suggested posts. Why would I want to see suggested post instead of what people are actually posting that I actually follow? If I wanted to follow those people I would I dont need a suggestion in the form of blending in with my newsfeed because I make an appointment and never follow any of those people or engage with their contact because I refuse to validate this practice. Plus its never anything interesting or follow worthy and it never will be. If I wanted to explore new people, Id go to the explore page. I am on a personal mission to Unfollow all businesses and celebrities to get my timeline back to looking like people I actually know and enjoying seeing instead of people that Ive thrown in my face for profit. If you keep working against that I just wont use the app. I follow 700 people, maybe 20 were celebrities. Youre telling me the celebrities post more content than the 680 other people I follow? You will literally show me a post that is a couple weeks old from a celebrity before you show me anything recent from real people. Then when the celebrity posts from the last month have ran out Im all caught up. Whenever I Unfollow the celebrities you place on my timelines instead of the regular everyday people I follow, you replace them with posts of more celebrities. You understand how this is counterintuitive right? Influencer culture is based on follows and engagement and your algorithm encourages me to unfollow and disengage with anyone you keep throwing in my face. I have to open my direct messages about five times before they will say that I read them. They started off only happening on my business account but now its also happening on my personal. I dont necessarily want to respond to every message that I see especially someone tagging me on their story so opening the message should be sufficient enough for it not to say that the messages unread. Simple. And just to be clear its not just messages that are tagging me and stories its regular messages as well.My stories have also started to lag with the audio meaning I will watch my story back or someone elses story and the audio will not play until I refresh the page or exit out of the story and press it again a few times. The sound is on on my phone and pressing the volume up switch while watching the video does not fix the issue so I think its another bug. Im not sure where all of the sudden bus came but its definitely time for an update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hacks and Spams. You need to do something about the hacks and spams in this social media, My wife account got hack and other people I know got hack to with porn stuff and money stuff. I dont trust or feel safe anymore using this app. When you try to get your stuff back you cant and you cant report the profile because it doesnt let you do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More privacy on photos. I guess if you make the privacy of IG similar to facebook then its will be amazing ,like i would control who can see my pictures and who cant .UPDATE: RECOMMENDATIONS:The archive tool is one of the best thing that Instagram had done. BUT It would be great if I can see the numbers of archived posts, So I dont over archive poststo see if how many pictures I archived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adds. My major is simple; before Instagram was bought by Facebook there were very few publicities. Ever since Facebook bought you, the app is filled with publicities, a whole lot more than before.

"Makes no sense. The algorithm is so stupid now. I want to see the posts from all the people I follow, not 1/3 and then a bunch of accounts I dont care about at all. I dont need suggested posts. I want the posts from the people I choose to follow or else what is the point of a social media account. Also, until you verify the people selling stuff on your app and do some scam prevention Im not going to buy anything off it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good app, privacy issues. Excellent app for photo sharing and social media contacts (personal and professional). My main criticism of the app is the contact syncing and settings which you have to navigate to adjust privacy settings. It is difficult to change these settings if you do not want your account visible to contacts on your phone, etc. The app immediately syncs your information and you have to go to the website or settings page to change this. I also do not like how it tracks your activity (another setting you have to change). These are features of a lot of social media companies that they prop up as ways to connect you to others and pages, but these settings should be simple and accessible upon creating an account. They should ask you clear questions with regards to these details when you create an account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zero privacy, full censorship. Unable to like posts because certain activity is restricted also have checked to not allow Instagram access to microphone and no cross app communication however daily random conversations result in immediate advertisements for the very subject I was just speaking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy update is terrible. We all know that Facebook (who owns Instagram) sells their customers data and doesnt care about our privacy. Drop these immoral baffoons. Cancel your account and delete the app. Email your photos to friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The worse app for privacy. According to the privacy report this application has contacted 253 domains or servers to share my information.This is unreal, Instagram that is meta should be banned from the App Store due to the fact that even thoughI deny tracking this app continues doing it and it does not respect the privacy policy set by Apple",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Cant find certain things on the app, used to see some good information that I know is 100% true, idk why Instagram removes the truth, wait I do, Chinese propaganda. Beware Americans, they are here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensitive content control issues. I use Instagram to be informed by non biased pages that inform on military world events such as popular front and atlas news but you guys just made it impossible for me to see their content as I cant change my sensitive control to allow only to Limit since I live in Canada this is completely unfair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"strict and unnecessary rules. There is so many guidelines to follow for an app that was just meant to post videos and pictures with filters. its not fun.

"Horrible. They are paid by the government and powers that be to not only still your information, But to control you with algorithms and strip your freedom speech. We need new social media companies that will respect its users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop controlling how we view our media. Instagram was the bomb when it was still young. Now that facebook owns the platform, they are basing our feeds off of what they think well like instead of letting us scroll through and finding it on our own. Sometimes I never see posts my friends make because its buried up by whoever paid facebook the most to be at the top of my feed. At least give me the option to view my feed how I want. Instagram is one of the very few ways Im able to see what my friends and family are doing but now its just whatever facebook wants me to like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram a tool for oppression, censorship and ethnic cleansing. Instagram and Facebook are censoring millions of posts that expose a terrorist regime; and are erasing the voices of people who are suffering and trying to get their voices to the world. Shame Shame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not Fair Policy. Instagram policy is not fair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SEX BOTS, SEX BOTS, AND MORE SEX BOTS. In the big world of social media. Instagram continues to stand out for the lack of control on the app. When it comes to deciding what you want to post. Instagram will come in and delete it. Now of course there are millions of posts just like yours but they feel it is just wrong to post those things. However its definitely family friendly with the millions of sex bots they allow to comment on every post. Instagram doesnt promote sexual content unless youre a sex bot. So moral of the story is: instagram is a huge multi million dollar company that cant seem to find a way to control the bots. So when you find your favorite post. Its followed by 1,000+ promoted, sexual, violent and other great bots. Instagram doesnt seem to care about the bots. While every comment section is filled with people complaining about the bots. Instagram still does nothing. Ill see people promoting drugs, promoting sex, Ive even seen people selling fake IDs. Now of course instagram is owned by Facebook. So you should expect that from them since they are known for their scandals and fake news and promotions. They dont have a real baseline of what they delete and what they dont. Youll post something and itll be deleted even tho nobody finds it offensive. But then youll see sex, drugs, and whatever else that instagram doesnt decide to delete. Youll reach out to them. Youll never hear back. Hell I blocked Instagram cause I just got annoyed of nothing being done. Ive got over 1000 people blocked and still see bots everywhere. Instagram needs to be sold to someone who wants to put in the work to actually make it a good app that REAL PEOPLE can communicate on rather than an app full of bots and fake news. Its becoming Facebook. Instagram will receive a no star from me until they figure out the annoying bots system. People get tired of seeing the same stupid comment on every post they go to. Whats the point of the comment section if its just filled with bots. Instagram will say one thing. But they wont follow through. Same as Facebook. They promised no more fake news. Well thats all you see on Facebook. I bet theyd till sell our info even tho they said they wouldnt do that anymore. Im disappointed in instagram, Facebook and of course Mark Sucksburg. He had a promising career until he started making unethical choices. Now hes just a failure who doesnt care about the people but is willing to cut any corners to fill his pockets. Elon musk was one of the most straight forward people who is passionate about what he does. Yet he got removed from his spot. Maybe its time Facebook and instagram put on their big boy and big girl pants and do what they need to do to make instagram and Facebook good again. Take the step and remove the dumb**s who is running these programs into the ground. Find someone who actually gives a sh*t about the company and what the people who use the social media platform want. I mean you got celebrities complaining for gods sake. And all you all do is make a new update that nobody gives a f*ck about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lil bubba. The review about insta watching/ listening, read the terms &amp; conditions privacy part it TELLS you targeted  advertising    &amp;   As for using WhatsApp instead , thats also owned by Facebook lolIf youve a mobile phone NOTHINGS private, for only real privacy youll need a burner phone,,   so Im told ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A true and honest review of this social media platform. Distracting, some how Instagram knew about my erectile disfunction before I said a word to anyone, it is useless and conveys a completely inaccurate perception on peoples lives, it just makes people want to sell themselves to nothing, and it collects data in ways inconceivable to anyone who is not familiar with the translation of wavelengths into information. I am not disappointed as I expected nothing more from a modern social platform. However I would like you to reconsider the methods and the obviousness of the extreme invasion of privacy in data collection. I know more than you think about the plans of social media so I suggest you go careful and maybe consider a more discrete and slow transitioned method of ensuring the desired mindset you would like people to attain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking. After I updated to ios 14.5, I immediately asked instagram to not track data as the new feature on ios allows you to do. I still notice my ads being tailored to what I have researched on safari. I was recently researching mercedes benz looking for a car and all of my ads have been for mercedes benz. I will be deleting this app. There is no reason for facebook to continue tracking data from users after it has been in legal trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just an overall terrible app now. Instagram isnt the same anymore. These updates are annoying. These reels (aka wanna be tiktoks) are annoying, especially wen having to scroll down my main feed and see a row of recommended reels that I dont want to see or even care about. Instagram has had the habit of copying every other app. First they copied snapchat and now theyre copying tiktok.. not only that but the community guidelines are ridiculous now as well. It is no longer a safe community. They are now deleting, blocking and logging people out of their Instagram account on the basis of violating community guidelines for using follower tracking apps. But when it comes to accounts that post pornographic photos videos or promote their pornography websites, children under the age of 13 having accounts, spam or the 2 million bots that exist on Instagram and stalk your account or Instagram story; absolutely nothing is done about them no matter how much you report it. I even had an experience in which I was impersonated. I along with 20 other people I know, reported the account for impersonation... I along with the 20 other people was told that people express themselves differently and the account does not go against community guidelines. I spent an entire day looking for a way to personally get in contact with Instagram (which was almost impossible) for them to then request that I send a picture of me holding my ID, for them to finally delete this account that was impersonating me.. what kind of community guidelines are these? What kind of community is this in general at this point? Its become an annoying, stressful and dangerous social media platform and Instagram (aka Facebook now that Facebook owns it) does not care This is unacceptable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook's influence. 1. Please go back to the simple chronological timeline. Period. 2. Consider allowing each picture be able to be private or public. This all or nothing public/private thing is annoying. 3. Keep cracking down on nudity and scammers in IG. 4. Facebook may own you but we are out here for a reason. To share photos. I'm not on facebook and don't want this to turn into another version of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Media. I really enjoy Instagram these days Facebook is way too political for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big tech censorship. We already have an unconstitutional government that oversteps in all aspects of life. We dont need another. Instagram is a mistake and is owned by the wrong people. Dont use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Business. Instagram helps us bring awareness to our cause and generate business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two peas in a pod. Instagram is Facebook, same censorship different platform. People are waking up to their biased. Facts aren&#39;t harmful just because they haven&#39;t been paid for by big tech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Value of Instagram. Hi, I would like to say that I remember a time when social media used to be more free from social ads and government controls. Unfortunately now everything has a connection with a money and limiting people from their rights",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insta for business. Im using Instagram for my business, and and it is the perfect way to network, engage with clients etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
READ ALL OF YOUR DATA THAT THEY TRACK Ridiculous invasion of privacy. Gross invasion of personal data. Read how they track your prior to downloading app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be bipartisan. It has become painfully obvious that Instagram and Facebook have become liberal leaning and suppress the views of conservatives, shutting down the conservative views that dont fall in line with liberal views. Manipulating explanations as to why one rule applies to one and not the other is going to be end of what was once a great social media outlet for opinions and views. Fact checking should be done by fact finding and NOT by fact sorting There is an obvious double standard which is the beginning of the end of what Instagram used to be. Because while it may please those who want to indoctrinate liberal views, what goes around comes around. And there comes a time when the lights go on and people realize whats happened and we will have social media war. Hitler lost remember? But not with having caused much destruction. Only a couple of countries are ruled that way, but this country wont go there again. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook owned. They will track you and use your posts against you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. If you post about politics just know that they will NOT show your new stories on the top of the app and they will NOT show your new posts. People will have to search for you directly. This is censorship; and exactly why Im deleting instagram. Its one of the most useless apps out here and I had 11k followers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unconstitutional. They allow for drag queens to spread their propaganda as well as antifa as well as terrorists and pedophiles but censors accounts that speak their minds about historical facts in order to protect corporate greed and credibility. Instagram and Facebook are both used to brainwash the world and are legally allowed to silence anyone they want and they silence all conspiracy theorists, legal cannabis growers, and anti vaxxers If you control what news people can say or share or see than you control those people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENSORSHIP. Instagram has turned into a crap social media app. The censorship is real. Government needs to do something about it adapt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Contributing to the collapse of modern guilt based society. Does not respect free speech. Has a strong bias in which content it promotes to new users as to which side of the political spectrum the content falls on. Uses the verification feature as a way to validate or invalidate people the moderators do or do not agree with on a political basis. Promotes shallow behavior and virtue signaling. Bans people, occasionally, not for violating terms of service or posting offensive things, but for being a person or being affiliated with people that Facebook, which owns Instagram, has deemed an undesirable. This app will be grouped in, when our time period becomes a price of history, with many which contributed to the degradation of society as it moved closer and closer to a great collapse it narrowly missed, like a malevolent meteor flying far too close to earth but eventually passing it without making contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insta. This such a good point of social media it is my fav out of all of the social media app that have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Instagram is using its power to censor and silence marginalized people. This isnt new But the new policies are unjustly targeting sex workers, IBPOC, LGBTQIA+, fat people, etc. This app is doing terrible things to our society",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Protects PEDOS, HATE CRIME, AND PREDATORS- NOT YOU. Guidelines dont get rid of violence, hate speech, extremist, and predators cause theyre too busy harassing 19yr olds tryna stay in college through onlyfans. Shouldve know being bought by Facebook would create this toxic environment on insta, but I had hopes that they would focus on the REAL problems and threats on the app. Im not a sw, but just seeing how they are treated on this app is disgusting, and Im not gonna support this app until they get it together. DO BETTER",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just...Why?. Why does Instagram/Facebook keep adding all of these features no one wants? I dont want Instagram TV or movies, I dont want Instagram Marketplace, I dont want to scroll down and suddenly be in a feed of suggested accounts, I definitely dont want a link with Messenger, and I dont want stories. I also dont want you spying in whatever way it is you do that suddenly shows me ads for something I just talked about. I just want to be able to see photos my friends shared in chronological order and comment on them if I feel like it. Thats it. If I wanted the other garbage Id be on Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ya, this aint instagram, its controlled consumption. Ive been on Instagram since 2014. I know this app way better than all my friends. Or at least, I did. The app just focus on consumption, its a tool to enforce capitalism at this point, literally all thats on the discover page is clothing and products for sale or women and bodys trying to enforce whatever the USA seems as beautiful for the time being. Its legit no longer sharing or expanding on ones personal interests. Its so so hard finding people I actually want to follow because at this point everything I get to actually see is all ads for random crap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theyre stealing your data. Dont use any Facebook apps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Appalling social media platform. Instagram censors information that is truthful. They are also censoring and hiding accounts speaking out about current affairs. Where is the freedom of speech? When I try to follow accounts that are speaking out, a box pops up stating the account is spreading false information. THIS IS WRONG",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IG RULES. Instagram allows me to write my lifes story and document my gratitude for being American,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zuckerbergs vision for humanity. Instagram and Facebook will trade our democracy for money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagrams New policies are awful. Instagrams new updates to their policies that allow them to collect information through your front camera are creepy and unacceptable. As is their bias and targeted policing of bodies and nudity. I am disgusted and I will be disabling my account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doesnt care about its users and violates peoples privacy. In their new policy update they made it so they have access to all the data on your phone and they actively use your microphone and camera to see what face expressions you make to shape what it shows you. This app very heavily restricts free speech and it bans people for no reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Instagram believes they are the ones who control our news, info, and what our believes should be.  F-u.. C-ya comrades",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Censorship is rampant. Instagram and Facebook are inundated by hackers and fake accounts. Posting anything that goes against their agenda will get you silenced. Their priorities are evil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Subpar Standards. If you dont value privacy and advocate liberal ideals, this is the platform for you. Instagrams best days are long gone after its parent company decided to monetize all statistics being harvested on this platform. The last straw was censorship of conservative users. Good luck getting half of your users back on the platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ITS BECOME PART OF OUR LIFE. SOCIAL MEDIA, SPECIALLY INSTAGRAM HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE , A WAY TO CONNECT WORLDWIDE AND LIKE THIS EXPLORE AND KNOW PEOPLE, CULTURE AND A HOLE NEW UNEXPLORED UNIVERSE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They steal your information. They can watch you through your camera at all times, even if you arent in the app. The new terms of use allows them to basically do whatever they want. They can check your text history, call logs, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrifying, Disgusting Targeted Ads & Content. Update: chronological feed only works for some accounts. This is the best feature since Facebook acquired Instagram (and actually was there before acquisition) and I cant even use it :(Update: PLEASE fire your product and ads teams. I have been receiving daily Instagram ads of various mental health disorders that I do not have. and there is no way for the user to regulate the ads at all. Its sickening and the entire team needs to be evaluated for sociopathy.  My last review isnt present, likely due to an app update, but the issues with harassing targeted media still continue. Feed content is so disgusting after recent harassment from California & uc berkeley employees towards app users (very ugly, naked, pregnant, unappealing photos recommended by followed hashtags that have nothing to do with the hashtag). Employees are obviously abusing their work privileges to harass users. Its sad seeing the apps content quality degrade to this level. I also dont have the chronological feature that was announced in the news. Meta doesnt care about user privacy since they wont prevent messages and accounts from being hacked. There should be an option to opt out of being a Guinea pig in this social experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. The only reason I use this is because its the only app, its a monopoly and should be government regulated .... freedom of speech is dead and instagram is killing it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trusting issue. Since Instagram take over by Facebook not liking using it. As Facebook loves to collect user data and sell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram Rules. Best social media platform going these days in my book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awful policy changes. Ive loved Instagram for years, but their recent policy changes targeting s*x workers and s*x educators are horrible, especially since this is being implemented during a global pandemic when many people rely on this platform for income.  The privacy issues are also becoming worse.  I have deleted the app and will not be reinstalling until changes have been made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When are you going to do something about this?. Hello, I have been using Instagram since 2012. It is a good social media app. You however, allow bots on your app and people who are offensive. I get mentioned by bots on certain pages of children that are ran by moms or to win free stuff that is expensive. I am also getting tagged to win free Fashion Nova gift cards, stuff that is in a different language, and more inappropriate stuff. If has been happening for years. You need to learn how to take further action when this stuff happens because Im not going to be able to take it anymore. Also, you allow people who use offensive words about people with special needs and races. I have reported a lot of that numerous times and it says that it doesnt go against Instagrams guidelines. But when I go on Twitter, they actually take action and do something about the situation. Also, why are you allowing children to be in danger? I know not children by themselves, but what about the accounts are ran by moms who think that inappropriate behavior is okay and it doesnt go against guidelines? I had a couple of social media friends who lost their fan accounts because you believed they were pretending to be somebody else, but then you allow the people who offensive, inappropriate, and the bots? What is wrong with you Instagram, I will not take it anymore. Twitter is doing a better job on this stuff and Ive seen one bot on there and Twitter knows what is bad and what is good. You need to learn how to be more professional.Update: now there are accounts who are obviously bots saying that their children are in emergency situations, mostly babies, they mention me on posts and comment on my page unnecessarily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Room for improvement. First off, it should be easier to just share certain photos from my camera roll, I refuse to give anything from Facebook full access to my camera roll. Its so difficult, and my opinion is that this is purposefully done to make you allow access to your full camera roll. The Instagram stories need to go. They are annoying and too much like Snapchat. There should be an ad-free option. Less tracking capabilities for US citizens. The Instagram before Facebook bought them out was great, but of course Facebook comes in and ruins everything they touch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Censors free speech. FB censors free speech.  Instagram is owned by FB.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political propaganda. Instagram used to be a fun app to share pictures and heck even promote your business. Now it has just become a propaganda tool for fascists. Stop censoring people, the recent hashtag censoring is the final straw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and control. Too much censorship and control. The values Instagram was about are no longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues. avoiding the usual facebook privacy issues, there are some concerning problems here:Recently I can see that Instagram is actively using the camera (seeing the green dot & text in control center) even when Im just reading direct messages or looking at photos in homeWhy? It should only use the camera when Im posting or adding a story Its so shady and weird",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too many restrictions and and bad policies. Having used Instagram now for over 4 years for the first time Ill write a review.  The policies on who is deemed to be popular and how pictures get to be seen are now ridiculous and instead of becoming a place that people can share art , its becoming a place for social posting selfies and food pictures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free speech please. As part of Facebook Inc, Instagram suffers from the same algorithm manipulation, vague community guidelines, and censorship as the parent app. The one clear thing is the political motivation behind these moves.Shame on you. Do better.Free Palestine ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We restrict cirton activities. I am sick to death with we restrict citron activities on instagram when I am just using it for the reason I am supposed to use it and it says we restrict cir-ton actives to proctec our community I understand you have to proctec people and keep people safe but the only people who should be doing it is the people who cant do the right thing like trolling cyber bullying and the people who are getting this noticfaction are the people who havent even done anething wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring Content. Instagram is censoring content that it determines unwanted. Whats the point of social media if we cant express ourselves freely? They are censoring posts related to the Sheikh Jarrah issue in Palestine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fulfilling my review promise. I&#39;m still trying to figure out what people love about Instagram so much. I check Facebook on my phone far more than Twitter or Instagram, because there&#39;s so much more that can be expressed there, considering how much less limited the functions are. Maybe I will never understand the &#34;super brief&#34; culture like Twitter and Instagram users do, but I&#39;m still here nonetheless. I need it for promotion anyway. Also, the story and news tabs are far too limited and brief. Anyway yeah I may never understand. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No freedom of media. Instagram has been limiting what I can and cant post, not to mention hiding my posts and stories from other Instagram users. Whats the point of freedom of speech and free media if its monitored and adjusted to someone elses preferences anyway?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wont let me even like posts. Ill admit I spend a decent amount of time on instagram so when I see the we restrict certain actions to protect our community when trying to like or follow an account its confusing and annoying. They dont give any explanation but just take away your ability to use a main feature of their app. What purpose can restricting this serve??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased political beliefs forced on you. The fact you can put your pronouns in your profile bio just says how far off the wagon gen z liberals are. Instagram forces certain political views on your feed no matter your opinion or beliefs. The fact you get fact-checked takes away our constitutional right of freedom of speech. I like Instagrams setup but its ran by a bunch of biased liberals that silence religions and politicians they dont like. Its unfair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instaspam. Instagram is heavily censored and aiding the mass genocide of the globe as is fb google and twatter The factards are funded by pharma google snd fb (FACT),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing but political garbage. Ive never been fond of Instagram but having the app has made it exponentially worse. I enjoy the accounts I follow, but the entire rest of the app is nothing but tik toks taken directly from other platforms. The app has little to no originality at this point, not to mention the politics. Im encouraged to put my pronouns in my bio, and when editing a post I see nothing but BLM stickers. Just disgusting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"important needs for instagram. we need to be able to see who viewed our page, and need a multiple select for our archive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media exodus to where?. Instagram & Facebook capitalize on abusing human psychology through algorithms.This is 1 review.Twitter has a text limit, and FB was for grannypics and continually being used Legacy-style gave them a datafarm with which to algorithmically abuse any user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Capitalism at its most exploitive. Ive had instagram since I was like 12-13 and over the years it went from a fun place to share photos and cultivate and online presence into an influencer saturated money grabbing mess. The final straw is that in this latest update they moved the notifications to the top of the screen and replaced it at the bottom with a shopping icon that brings you to a bunch of products that they think youll be interested based on harvesting your personal information Im sick of constantly being advertised to and prodded into buying useless items Not to mention how bad it is seeing your friends and strangers highlight reels of their life 24/7. Instagram is made to make you feel inadequate. Im deleting it and I hope you do to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram Empowers for Health. It is a powerful medium for dissemination of powerfully empowering information pertaining to health. Thanks from sanoMD_blog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lack of report system. Instagram has more potential than it has now. But a few issues are what keeping them from pulling out of from the others. First is the amount of bots, fake, and duplicate accounts that are on IG. Myself and some others  (possibly) use IG as a place for photography, businesses, reaching a broader community to share the similar likes, or just for fun. With those few listed accounts, it limits who can see your posts and your account. I can see/understand if someone has a business and personal account. But to have 3+ accounts that are the exactly the same and are troll pages then why keep them up? Also there are times especially now (not sure if its happening to some people or not) is accounts and people who are clearly going against the TOS and guidelines with their posts and accounts. No matter if its drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nudity or sexual images. Some are showing up in popular feed (whatever its called) and some though scrolling through posts. Like earlier yesterday/today I tried reporting dozens of posts and accounts of completely naked women and a few of drugs and tobacco in use that showed up and all IG said was that it doesnt go against their guidelines. How does all of this not go against the guidelines?? Also reported a account that supposedly had gotten removed on a couple different occasions but still on their as of yesterday with basically no consequences other than a couple pictures that were reported and removed. So I dont know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IG is Propaganda. Facebook controls what you see and what you post so you are gaslighted to believe only their narrative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pass on media censorship. Not a fan of media telling me what I am allowed and and not allowed read. Too many ads and not enough about what I care about. I cant even send private messages to my family and friends that arent on Instagrams liberal agenda. What a disappointment. Apps like this remind us we arent living in the AMERICA we thought we signed up for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and profiles being deleted. Things that should be censored such as child pornography, nudity, and violent acts are left on Instagram while profiles that practice freedom of speech and unbiased opinions are deleted and censored because they are too offensive. Instagram has become more of a platform for politics and debate but I still enjoy posting pictures and reels from time to time. The censoring of freedom of speech needs to stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instagram is bias. This platform is extremely bias. They allow some people to say the most disrespectful, distasteful, racist, sexist and vile comments and sensor OTHERS. Im only on the app to share photos with friends and family that are long distance and speak my mind when I choose. This platform doesnt allow for that from people of color",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram likes human trafficking. Instagram used to fix the reporting issues. Were you able to leave a response of why we are reporting they  say  doesnt go against guidelines but its actually human trafficking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social responsibility. Hi, Im waiting for instagram to hide the number of video view counts and the amount of likes so I can rate it 5 starts. I think there are too many documented disadvantages by different psychological studies of the negative impact these social media traits have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Support free speech. Instagram is full of bs just like Facebook blocking the truth while pushing towards a narrative not from the people but more for politics and foreign interest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insta. Ive had insta for about a year. I wont make this paragraph too long. Instagram is so fun to use especially when you want to post photos you love. You can put your account in private or public. I dont have too much to say anyway, but if youre looking for a good social media app, get Insta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New policies are messed up. Constantly missing out on my posts due to shadow bans and screwed up algorithms. New terms of services are damaging and disgusting, and the layout is unintuitive. Actual content I want to see is blocked by ads/other sponsored crap because Instagram only highlights posts with more saves than likes, its messed up. Actual content creators get so screwed. Uninstalled, sick of the manufactured nonsense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Suppresses important information from other platforms. Instag and facebook both togather have been working side by side to stop revealing important humane news, eg ethnic cleansing, Israel displacing Palestians to allow illegal settlers. They even hide hashtags that support any important case that would make US look bad, eg with Flloyd being murdered by police man. Therefore, i cant say Instagram support transparency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unnecessary. Ive had a Instagram since 2010 and Ive never been restricted for how many photos Im allowed to like. Or for how many people Im allowed to follow or Unfollow what type of controlling act is this? No wonder everyone is deleting their account,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"censorship. I use Instagram to keep in contact with family and friends while traveling, and only because its the only app like this available. instagram censors what is allowed by fact checking (which is a load) and only allowing what they want. p0rnhub has an account, but hashtags for those insured by pharmaceuticals are blocked. then they claim its got the safety and security of those using the app. lies. this app is bought and when theres a similar option available, Im off here for good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useful and fun but also discriminatory. I dont like how Instagram tries to cover up stuff that it disagrees with, that I have met a lot of great people here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great platform for social media. Black lives matter, and this app is very reliable for information",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Big oof to censorship. Your censorship ruins the whole experience. I get the Basic criminal stuff might need censoring, but why you censoring some of the opinion stuffs? Or theory stuff that isnt facts, im not going on instagram to see facts, i like seeing all the different peoples perspectives, and your censoring gets in the way of people understanding eachother. I should be the one choosing what content i want to look at, not yall Edit: also why would you remove the share button as wellll damn i was enjoying sharing all those good memes, maybe the app is starting to die. rip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much censorship. Fact checking and censorship is out of control. This app is easily going down hill and most people will agree. Meta/instagram is at risk of loosing a vast majority of its users to new social media apps that are far less restrictive and less bias toward opinions deemed fringe from unpopular political figures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Filtering based on preference. Shame on you insta for filtering important content that can save lives funding a global agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram is using you for your data. Not a hater I just want in on the hustle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review-. Insta gram allows me to share my work through social media. It allows for prospect clients to see the work I perform and can service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram rating. Instagram is a platform for adults only and according to American tradition youre not an adult till youre 18.  Instagram is a good platform to express creativity free from ridicule and harassment be an indirect or direct harassment. Instagram is a respected platform unlike Facebook were bitter people from the past will make up rumors to ruin your future because they havent done anything original.  Teenagers should not be allowed to use smart phones because the adult industry is letting in teenagers and thinking its cool Legend has it that People get tied to railroad tracks for child molestation.  So why are parents letting their teens use smart phones to make underage pornography?  Its illegal for teens to access smart phones and send naked pictures of them selves especially when their parents pushing them into do it just so that their parent can get rich thats illegal if a 16 year old wants to date an 18 year old that relationship is to be very exclusive and private and nobodys business. If my daughter was 16 and a 22-year-old at a video game store was hitting on her Im tying the 22-year-old to a railroad track for that grow up and get someone your own age Its OK for me to holler at a under age female because shes overweight and itll make her feel attractive but its not OK for me to holler at a woman thats in her late 20s or early 30s which is close to my age because she takes care of herself and shes slim and fit. This is where you have to talk to the parents about their childs obsessiveness. This is also where you need to talk to the parent about how to be an actual parent instead of a criminal.  Facebook is obsolete and mark Zuckerberg Id like to kindly ask for the harassment to stop you stole Facebook and made it your own idea Instagram is original and Instagram is a safe platform Facebook is not. On Facebook my ex girlfriend spread her racist rumors about me and shes also had her redneck hillbilly friends pull an AR 15 on me for saying Im not interested in big beautiful women I rest my case Im not OK with a large woman trying to kill me because Im not interested in her thats called rape. This Instagram account is to let everybody know I am safe.  I have a calling card and an image for it that lets people know Im safeAnd I have my own brand of playing cards dropping soon. Id like to thank the creators of Instagram for allowing this opportunity to happen and being part shareholder thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reporting. The App itself is great, but the use of this feature is worthless. There are categories on what you can report a photo/video for, Sexual Acts, Violence, Self-Injury, Suicide, all these are not taken seriously enough. Instead of such getting deleted &amp; accounts taken down, they&#39;re left with a &#34;View Content&#34; over top. I&#39;ve encountered accounts who have continuously posted gore, animal abuse as well as child pornography &amp; have not had any measures taken against them. Instagram needs to amp up their responsibilities &amp; get this stuff taken DOWN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and discrimination. Whats on your mind? Asked Facebook, before it went on to censor whats on your mind... Got a memory of a dictator in mind? Take that memory and apply it to all the social media apps owned by Facebook. Instead of being an open platform for the world to freely and indiscriminately engage in, the Facebook owned social network is being used for the benefit of tyrannical and unjust political parties and is being used as a huge tool to deliberately and falsely influence public opinion by means of one-ended censorship. The saying that you are the product when you are not paying for a service is coming into full effect. We have become products subject to mass surveillance and censorship based on our world views, beliefs and racial background. What we all thought was freedom of expression was an invasion of privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Discrimination. Censoring and shadow-banning accounts that share footage of the humanitarian crisis in Palestine and blaming it on a glitch is dishonest and unjust. Social media has been the main tool for disseminating information, by ordinary citizens on the front line. The Israeli governments Cyber Unit has effectively silenced thousands of voices by making requests with Facebook to delete anything that isnt in their favour. The head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri himself said in an interview, We&#39;ve realized that we have a lot of responsibility to understand how our platform is used and to address any abuses whenever possible. It would be great of him to realise that responsibility and the immense power this app has, and to uphold human decency in allowing ordinary citizens to share their lived experiences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unnecessary. Found instagram unnecessary and irrelevant. No longer a space  to share life with others. Now its all be an activist or you dont care. Influencers are stupid as they are paid to share an opinion, not authentic or original.  So its been deleted for 6 months now and became a beekeeper with all my spare time  Also who wants to be tracked all the time? Not me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KEEP POST SUPPORT. I do not support the decision the creators of instagram and the board that decides what changes are made are not support posts on their platform. So many people depend on that and when they depend on Instagram they choose to trust them to some capacity. That trust is broken when they go to far with power. It&#39;s called social media for a reason. It is supposed to be for the people who use it just as much as the people who technically own it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
censorship and invasion of privacy. apps been going downhill since FB bought IG fk your censorship fk your agenda fk your policies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awful App, Dont Bother Getting. I downloaded instagram because everyone else was getting it, but I noticed that it says on its terms &amp; conditions that it has access to all your photos, your camera, your call history, your EVERYTHING, even when youre not in the app. I am absolutely digested and disappointed. I had high expectations for this app and it did not meet those standards. I will be deleting my account AND the app itself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship & Double standard policies. Do better Instagram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just like face booksmh. The whole reason i quit facebook is because it sucked and they dont have any regard to who they sell your info to. But since its meta (go figure) you would think that they would get their $#+ together. Nope one example, i cant even change the privacy on my account because i cant access the blue button to change it. Because you would think that meta and its staff wouldn't overlook such a big detail. But they did. Because they want to put your whole life out there despite your privacy preference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Medical censorship. Just like Facebook, Instagram censor medical professionals at the very top of their field. They also ban accounts that give information that is not seen on the news on our TVs.I had a page with 40k followers, every post was backed up by factual information and links to prove it. Censorship is not science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook fumbling it. Too many ads, feed never in chronological order, community guidelines are dangerously strict and do hide the truth. At its lowest point but will always be the best social media app ever made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram. It is baist by politics and not allow us to talk or express our opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. I might delete Instagram after what I saw and heard about no privacy they are looking at the pictures from our phones no privacy whatever were doing on your phone they want know and thats just disturbing and weird and disgusting and I might put 2 starts instead of three.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Read. Just gonna say it Instagram is very like sketchy it can access data from your other apps and can access your camera and microphone at any time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Longer bios & privacy disaster. Bios should be able to contain a lot more info. So annoying.Also this app is a privacy disaster. Why does it notify people your friend _____ is on Instagram as @_____??? I run accounts that I dont want my friends to be notified aboutThere are so many other privacy issues besides just that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No right to my data. It now wants to track what apps you use They have no right to ask for right to spy on their users Dont let them have that right to see your phones activity or the apps you use. Its your device they did not pay for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Power at the Pass. The distinct value proposition of Instagram in social media networking is off the charts. We are very appreciative of the services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The terms and service. The terms and service is basically an invasion of privacy. They can read your messages, see your calls, use your pictures without your permission and basically do anything. They can also analyze your cameras so...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Important. Why People with higher amount of followers are not included in Instagram policies? Women nipples are against the policies but lots of pages with high followers upload photos & videos and they dont get bannedThats not fair at all. I lost my account without warning because there was a unnoticeable nipple under lingerie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keeping us connected. Instagram lets us quickly and easily share what weve up to during these times, sharing humour and information that helps us keep safe ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They Allow too Much Inappropriate content. I have always love Instagram but within the last year or so the amount of content that is inappropriate and nearly illegal has increased 1000 fold They are extremely unhelpful when your account is hacked and you will not get it back unless you know someone who works there. There is clear favoritism towards those accounts they prioritize and can make a profit on. Its not a app you want to invest in in the long run.  If you are not a Gen Z at least point you are already irrelevant to the company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fulfilling my review promise. I\'m still trying to figure out what people love about Instagram so much. I check Facebook on my phone far more than Twitter or Instagram, because there\'s so much more that can be expressed there, considering how much less limited the functions are. Maybe I will never understand the \super brief\ culture like Twitter and Instagram users do""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Community Guidelines. Instagram is a very great social media app but lately I have been unfollowing a lot of people and Instagram said that they limit certain things to protect people. Why should it matter how many people I follow and unfollow its my business. I can unfollow so many people and then get block from doing so. If this doesnt get resolved I can promise that I will no longer be using Instagram the Community Guidelines are just out of control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censors information. Freedom of speech is vital to a free society and Instagram censors so much information and keeps it from people. This needs to change. Opinions and healthy debate with respect to others is vital, we need to respect and not just cancel others who think different than us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically facebook/tiktok but bad. instagram does not care about what the people actually want. every update it gets worse and worse. if they LISTENED they would go back to their original style with original values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insights. It would be really good if instagram makes insights on our storys and post; have more info like who has reached our posts or who has clicked on stickers put on our story etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Brainwashing, manipulative, and suppressive. Algorithms at Instagram does three main things: - Push political agendas of Israel - Suppress human rights violations by messing up with the views on videos documenting human right violations in Palestine and Syria - Invade your privacy by selling your personal information to the highest bidder to sell you stuff and make their users their main product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racist. Instagram and Facebook are both biased and racist and discriminate against race as opposed to anything else. Horrible tech companies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 years on social media. If you are going to use this app , likes do not describe who you are as a person . You wont feel like your living life to the fullest using this app . I used this app of 4 years and have a big following . But I learn It also makes you feel unworthy most the time . If you do use Instagram, only use it when you want to post something then delete the app when not using , so you dont spent so much time on it , dont lie to yourself with others opinions or interests it will only make you someone you are not .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awful reporting and community guidelines system. As most of you know, Instagram went on a mass restricting spree of accounts with Black Lives Matter sources linked in their bios. I cant believe how disgustingly racist that is. However Ive also noticed that accounts owned by minorities have been consistently banned or restricted for no reason, while accounts that post actual racist and malicious content stay up and face no consequences. This apps reporting system and community guidelines is an absolute joke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great before they tried to get all my other info. Nope, you may not access all of my accounts on my phone and all of my photos. Privacy is a real thing Why would you make your app bad by thinking it was ok to invade mine? I wonder how many other people have not read your new terms of use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very invasive of privacy. forces you to get the app and give personal information to reactivate your account,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Engagement. Instagram needs to fix their engagement and algorithm its beyond broken and needs to be fixed immediately so people that run business accounts can get their product or photos out to the world without Instagram restricting who see the post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now that Facebook bought it. Its not the same. Its selective on who is in your newsfeed. Now that Facebook bought it, I dont like that it chooses what posts you see. They dont even monitor, delete and act on reports like fake accounts and people soliciting sex.  Way too many ads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blocking truthful information. Instagram fact checking information and claiming its false because it goes against what our corrupt government is telling us and the scamdemic...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lost its own purpose. all it is anymore is an advertisement. I just want to see my friends photos not companies and influencers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. In classic Facebook-management fashion, Instagram has taken steps to marginalize and censor Palestinian and Palestine-supporting users of the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useful and fun, but still plenty of issues. First of all, I dont doubt that I use Instagram differently than most of their users.I use Instagram for three purposes: (a) sharing content from my own life, (b) keeping up with content from my friends/family/coworkers and a select few local/relevant accounts, and (c) updating my business pages with consistent content to drive real-world participation in my non-profit program.What I do NOT use Instagram for is the consumption of random content, even around set themes. I honestly do not care in the slightest what people I dont know are sharing on this app The new suggested posts on my feed are not what I want (thankfully I can snooze them for 30 days, but I want to disable them indefinitely) and the disgusting mess that is the Discover tab is terrible.I understand why ads exist in the feed, but there needs to be a better way to tell the app what ads Id like to see. Its a waste of money for advertisers to show me irrelevant content anyway so if I must see the occasional ad, Id like it to at least be something related to my personal interests.If I want to buy something, there are several places Ill look. Do you know where Id never consider looking? Instagram I dont want that useless shopping tab. Even if I was to find something I like there, Id never connect a payment method to anything thats a part of Facebook (You can call yourself Meta if you want, but youre still just Facebook)Another tab I dont want: Reels. I know, I despised Stories when they came out and now I use that all the time  but Reels is designed around a terrible concept: taking advantage of short attention spans and doomscrolling. If I could only see Reels from accounts I follow, I might be interested. But as I said above, I dont care about random accounts 99% of Reels Ive seen from people I dont follow are extremely low quality and an incredible waste of time.The Facebook app on iPhone lets users hide some tabs. Can I please hide the Shop and Reels tabs on Instagram?A really important point is that Instagram is frequented by teenagers  and that fact makes the abundance of adult content in the app unacceptable. Instagram policies have some imperative protections, but its far from adequate If I had kids of my own, I wouldnt even consider let them have Instagram. Its just too easy to pollute a young mind by browsing this app. Please, get this under control. Start by actually doing something about this content when it comes by in reports, and not ignoring nearly all reports that should result in content removal.Lastly, Im still very frustrated that this app doesnt have native support for iPad. The Instagram team claims there arent enough users to warrant the development and upkeep, but (a) many of those users, such as myself, dont show in your numbers because we dont install the iPhone-only app on our iPads and (b) natively supporting iPad when you already support iPhone is very easy with Apples developer APIs. You could do all of that management on devices themselves, and your servers and whatever else wouldnt need to worry about it. Its not difficult please just do it A feed with multiple columns of posts to scroll through would be great, and Im still really hoping well finally get that someday in the near future.Alright, thats it. My verdict? Instagram is far from great, but I enjoy it for the most part. I wish it wasnt owned by Facebook, but at least that should theoretically increase their budget and update frequency. I want to see Facebook fail, but Id like Instagram to stick around for the time being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Newsfeed is AWFUL Resharing stories Bug. I follow maybe 20 celebrities and my entire newsfeed is made up of posts from 10 of those celebrities no matter how old the posts are. I almost never see posts from real people and Ive had to Unfollow pretty much every celebrity to even begin to see real people on my timeline. Using suggested post as the default layout instead of chronological order makes it so that I dont use Instagram much because every time I get on it feels like Im being sold something instead of engaging with people I actually know. Instagram has turned into craigslist and it will go downhill until you start giving people what they want not what you want to sell them. My timeline is 10 posts from 10 celebrities and then it starts with the suggested posts. Why would I want to see suggested post instead of what people are actually posting that I actually follow? If I wanted to follow those people I would I dont need a suggestion in the form of blending in with my newsfeed because I make an appointment and never follow any of those people or engage with their contact because I refuse to validate this practice. Plus its never anything interesting or follow worthy and it never will be. If I wanted to explore new people, Id go to the explore page. I am on a personal mission to Unfollow all businesses and celebrities to get my timeline back to looking like people I actually know and enjoying seeing instead of people that Ive thrown in my face for profit. If you keep working against that I just wont use the app. I follow 700 people, maybe 20 were celebrities. Youre telling me the celebrities post more content than the 680 other people I follow? You will literally show me a post that is a couple weeks old from a celebrity before you show me anything recent from real people. Then when the celebrity posts from the last month have ran out Im all caught up. Whenever I Unfollow the celebrities you place on my timelines instead of the regular everyday people I follow, you replace them with posts of more celebrities. You understand how this is counterintuitive right? Influencer culture is based on follows and engagement and your algorithm encourages me to unfollow and disengage with anyone you keep throwing in my face. I have to open my direct messages about five times before they will say that I read them. They started off only happening on my business account but now its also happening on my personal. I dont necessarily want to respond to every message that I see especially someone tagging me on their story so opening the message should be sufficient enough for it not to say that the messages unread. Simple. And just to be clear its not just messages that are tagging me and stories its regular messages as well.My stories have also started to lag with the audio meaning I will watch my story back or someone elses story and the audio will not play until I refresh the page or exit out of the story and press it again a few times. The sound is on on my phone and pressing the volume up switch while watching the video does not fix the issue so I think its another bug. Im not sure where all of the sudden bus came but its definitely time for an update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Events. How come we can&#39;t create events like we do on Facebook?  FB and Insta are owned by the same company forever now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When are you going to do something about this?. Hello, I have been using Instagram since 2012. It is a good social media app. You however, allow bots on your app and people who are offensive. I get mentioned by bots on certain pages of children that are ran by moms or to win free stuff that is expensive. I am also getting tagged to win free Fashion Nova gift cards, stuff that is in a different language, and more inappropriate stuff. If has been happening for years. You need to learn how to take further action when this stuff happens because Im not going to be able to take it anymore. Also, you allow people who use offensive words about people with special needs and races. I have reported a lot of that numerous times and it says that it doesnt go against Instagrams guidelines. But when I go on Twitter, they actually take action and do something about the situation. Also, why are you allowing children to be in danger? I know not children by themselves, but what about the accounts are ran by moms who think that inappropriate behavior is okay and it doesnt go against guidelines? I had a couple of social media friends who lost their fan accounts because you believed they were pretending to be somebody else, but then you allow the people who offensive, inappropriate, and the bots? What is wrong with you Instagram, I will not take it anymore. Twitter is doing a better job on this stuff and Ive seen one bot on there and Twitter knows what is bad and what is good. You need to learn how to be more professional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obvious Agenda. We can see whos agenda Instagram really cares about when posts promoting the human rights of people being persecuted in Palestine or China are being removed, blocked and pages shadow banned.Stop the censorship of facts For a company that preaches about communication, it sure as hell doesnt like the truth of Israels war crimes becoming more accessible. It sure doesnt want the world to react to the millions of Uighur people in concentration campsOr the people being bombed and murdered across the globe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not my fave social media app. I think it WAS one of the best resources for connecting with other networks such as fitness and health. It offers lots of inspiration through pics and video that are worth watching. But I dont like all the changes and updates that have been made throughout the years. I have tried numerous times to reach out to their customer service to find out why certain aspects of Instagram doesnt work with my account like the use of their music. I used to be able to have music played during my stories but now I dont have that option at all. I was never contacted back with any explanation so they definitely lack in customer service area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Concerns. Im considering deleting my account and app due to privacy concerns with the new terms of service going into effect on 12/20/20. Stop spying on us Instagram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1st amendment. Lots of censorship. If you dont have Instagrams preferred political opinion, you are not allowed to speak your mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"biased and hypocritical policies. Instagram should be ashamed of how biased it can be with its censorship especially that it calls for awareness on some issues to look ethical, while others are silenced. The world is watching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insta. I love the filters and the fact that I can automatically have the pics I share send to Facebook as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything is money. Instagram used to be about posting fun things with your friends, enjoying your feed, etc. Now its become a platform that only cares about the amount of money you spend to promote your profile in an attempt to be famous. The timeline is so out of order, I never see more than 3 peoples posts anymore. Their customer service and response team is AWFUL. Your issues will never be solved as they just ignore them. Finally, shadow banning. That is the WORST thing theyve come up with. Im not paying for people to see my pictures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bait and Switch. So many things to say here - making the feed end after two new updates and then filling it with content I dont follow, taking the + button away from the bottom but putting the shopping button almost in the same place, Instagram is clearly about making a buck off of you wherever they can or controlling what you see. And before you say its the algorithm, Im talking about the interface here. But most concerning are the invasive liberties Instagram is taking with my data. No thanks. IG used to be fun years ago but now its absorbing my time, making me work to see people I care about while spamming me with products and influencers I dont ever want to see. All at the price of them being able to see my location, my face, my credit card info, my browser, my contacts, my private messages. Just like I left Facebook two years ago, Im out ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Policies applied without respect. For awhile I enjoyed the app, but my account was deactivated without any valid reason (@rene.beta) I couldnt report the issue and there was no customer service. Years of pictures and memories were deleted in one second by Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy, data harvesting, and more. So to begin, Google (YouTubes owner) has already been in hot water over just how much personal data they mine from people. Google maps tracking people when they explicitly turned tracking off comes to mind.YouTube is doing something rather similar, why do you need to know my location? Why do you need to know my contacts? Why do you need to know my purchase history? Why do you need to know my browsing history? Not my just YouTube browsing history but my browsing history outside of YouTube? The YouTube app itself is great, tons of content, good informative videos, entertaining ones, music, its got it all. But its business practices and how it treats its customers and content creators is downright exploitive and disgusting. Ive already mentioned the privacy violations, but lets go on to some of the other issues. YouTube seems to think that censorship is good, and that they can demonetize a video that violates their ever changing rules. Yet they can still place ads on those video and receive income from them. If the video wasnt suitable for advertisements due to its content, then why is YouTube able to monetize it for themselves? I dont think its due to the content being inappropriate. Its YouTube stealing from its content creators. Whom they think shouldnt have a say in how YouTube runs. Reminds me of Uber now that I think about it. Someone says a curse word? Demonetized. Someone shows a firearm? Demonetized. Someone doesnt agree with YouTube? Demonetized. But hey YouTube can still profit from those videos anyways. Honestly I believe that should fall under theft of intellectual property. If the content creator cant receive the benefits, then neither should YouTube. Dont like it? Perhaps lessen your ever tightening grip? Im in full support of preventing pornography, gore, and other inappropriate things to be shown on YouTube. However, when you put out ads showing and heavily implying things of a sexual nature, well it seems to be hypocritical. Its almost as if you dont actually care about your rules, so long as you make money. Last issue I will mention is your allowing of the removal of the likes/dislikes. I understand comment sections can sometimes get out of control and need to be removed. However, likes and dislikes are a way for the consumer to know if a video is good or bad. Removing it prevents us from knowing if the video were watching is legitimate, or if its a colossal waste of our time. YouTube will still get that ad revenue though, even if you wasted 10-15 minutes of your time. In my opinion, google and YouTube are a monopoly. Theres no other place on the internet for this type of content. Due to this they have abused their position time and time again. Whether it was cracking down on something they disliked or simply for the sake of greed. No company should have a monopoly on a service nor should they treat peoples lives as a commodity to be bought and sold for profit. We already pay for your services with the ads, you do not need to steal our personal information on top of that. Why 3 stars? They get 1 star for the content, which they dont actually create. 2 stars so that people who dont go to the extremely negative reviews can see this. Do your own research, and really look into how horrible of a company or rather monopoly they are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the worst apps in the App Store. This is one of the absolute app and service there is. They should he honest and just call it an advertisement app. Not only is Google spying on everyone and sell our information for some mega bucks, but they play stupid ad after ad after ad. YouTube now has more ads than an advertisement agency. When an ad comes up mid roll I just stop watching. And to top it off, to subscribe is more expensive than Netflix, HBO, or pretty much any movie/streaming service. Greed at its best Perhaps they should have different prices for different services. I own over 5,400 songs. I buy my music, not rent it. Run out of money and kiss your music bye bye. Therefore I dont care for anyones music service. Why should I pay for something I dont need or use? Oh that is right, I remember now, Googles crazy greed But I am happy to say that I have cut back my use of Youtube by at least 90 to 95%. Some days I don\'t use it at all. And trust me, if feels good And top to it off now in order for me to log in to any Google app or service, Google wants me to give them my cell phone number. Funny Google, do you honestly think that I am going to provide you with my number? You have got to be kidding me Google, the most powerful spy company that collects and sells people\'s personal information with complete disregard to privacy wants my number. Haha Yeah right  And if anyone reading this (which will most likely disappear from the reviews) think that Google respects your wishes when you change your privacy settings, you\'ve got to wake up from that fantasy. Seriously Google, stop the spying on people and stop kidnaping peoples accounts only because you want more personal information of your users so that you can better keep track of them and sell that information. And for those who think that they don\'t care about companies such a Google and Facebook spying on them because they have nothing to hide, I will leave you with a quote from an USA hero, Edward Snowden: \Saying that you don\'t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide it\'s no different than saying you don\'t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. It\'s a fundamentally un-American principle. And more than nationalism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immoral use of data. Google has a complete disregard for the privacy of their users. They are taking advantage of the ubiquity of their product to misuse data collected by their own algorithm and from other online sources to increase viewing time. I&#39;m tired of seeing video recommendations that are clearly based on my activities all over the internet. It&#39;s creepy and invasive, and you know it. Shame on you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bad Google - No Privacy for YouTube. One of the few Google apps that has had an update requiring them to disclose their privacy practices. I have to say even with the expectation that theyd be up to no good with my data, I am shocked at how much they use that I am not ok with. Shame on you Google and YouTube. Apples privacy choices cannot come soon enough and I cant wait to chop the you know what off of YouTube apps Trojan horse invasion into my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Security. The privacy policy of YouTube is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Control. Its not good enough that Google gathers info on every internet user on the planet, but they want to control what you say on YouTube as well. Im not talking about violating their policies, Im talking about speaking truth to power. They will censure you without acknowledging they did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont censor the information. Your total control of content will be your fall. Google is a totalitarian  technology, but you have forgotten that your success is up to us, so when we have enough, youll start losing the business and that will mark your downfall.Dont censor YouTubers because WE ARE BILLIONS, and WE WILL FIGHT BACK, and nobody escapes from Karma and Justice.Keep that in mind artificial intelligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wake up about google/youtube, people. No one else minds how Google is trying to control your life more and more? I wont get started on how they track your every move, record your every move, log your every keystroke, and compile your every purchase for their schemes and sell that information to who knows for marketing purposes. They purposely manipulate their YouTube website so that you cant use it on a phone so you are forced without choice to use their ad laden, DATA MINING APP that is constantly siphoning your personal information for its advertisers and other maniacal schemes. They dont want you to use the website so you cant use your ad blockers to block their ads and trackers (which I do, and will continue to do) and make the website unreliable and unable to even load live events. Well Id rather just go back to not using YouTube at all instead of being muscled into this horrible app and buying their made up, premium features and subscriptions. Goodbye Lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube. Im writing this review and giving it 5 stars so that hopefully the app developers will pay attention to what I have to say. Because sooner or later they will understand the importance of peoples Privacy The biggest problem with this app is its always tracking your searches and it does it behind your back so to speak. The settings are very confusing considering you have to log into Google every time and even then no matter how you set your privacy they still track everything you search given out your information to unwanted entities and hacker websites. I have use this app for around 3 years and have been hassled with phone call messages and so on. Because this app is giving out my information with out my permission. Its a awesome app to watch videos and gain needed information or just watching videos. But it comes at a cost and thats is your privacy. So if you dont mind having your information gave out to hacker you will love this app . But to be honest the developers could make this app settings much more simpler to control your privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spying and advertisement at it's best app. Wow, not only does Google (owner of YouTube) doesn't care about people's privacy, as their whole company and products are design for the collection and sales of people's personal information, but they don't like criticism. My review of their lousy YouTube app keeps disappearing. Youtube used to be a good platform. That was until Google took over. Now it has more ads than an advertisement agency. Google took a great idea and flushed it down the toilet with their excessive ads. Ad after ad after ad. They should change it's name from Youtube to AdTube. At the same time, I am thankful that they have let their greed take over. The excessive ads have pushed me to stop using it as much as I once did. I have cut my use of the app by about 90%. I only use it to look up reviews about products I am considering buying. And, a while back I decided to do something, I would not purchase, consume, or use an product that is advertise in YouTube. With the exception of very few products. To my surprise, literally just about every product I see advertise in YT are products I do NOT care for. Products I never have or would never buy. But hey Google, you really need to cut back on ads. In forums around the net people are talking about how YT has been ruined by the excessive ads. Don't you already make enough money from all the spying you do on us? Come in Google, the world knows your are not a company that designs, develops, and sales electronic products. The bread and butter of your company, the money maker, is shamelessly spying in people and selling our personal information. Haven't you seen the documentary A Social Dilemma? Eye opening Perhaps you should develop a little sense of common decency and cut back on the lousy ads. Because as it is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Privacy, efficiency, interface environment. Its obvious that google keeps track of you and listens to you but its gone too personal for me due to how obvious and annoyingly these advertisements target users. Frankly, this turned for an absolutely disgusting and rude experience especially with premium subscription pop ups after closing the app mid video then opening to a pop up i repeatedly say no to.Sometimes even DURING videos with pauses or any interaction you give to the video - they find ways to hit you with annoying and daunting way-too personal ads. Google has turned this interface and environment thats supposed to benefit and comfort the user with efficiency, into a straight up night mare and job of an app with the ridiculous and obviously shady decisions of google.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will figure out what kind of person you are and recommend content that you are most likely to click on, regardless of whether you are clicking on it for healthy or unhealthy reasons.

Dont download this unless you cant access youtube on your phone browser or somewhere else. They also intentionally design youtube so it doesnt work as well on non-chrome browsers. Youtube itself is filled with clickbaity disingenuious garbage with the rare quality content now and again. DO WE REALLY NEED TO GIVE UP SO MUCH OF OUR PRIVACY TO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS? I dont think we do.

"Holy Privacy Label. They collect and sell essentially every aspect of my personal life, the only thing Google is missing is a DNA sample. If you value your privacy even in the slightest, dont use YouTube with a signed-in account.

"Owned by Google, Privacy Nightmare. YouTube collects and stores personal information that is not needed for maintaining and improving the app, instead to sell.

Security issues. I wish that Google and YouTube would be more attention and catch people who infiltrate peoples devices through their apps they hack them and they take their sensitive information and they stream about it live on their YouTube channels.

"My personal beliefs about YouTube. Dear YouTube followers and YouTubers, I think YouTube is an amazing way to get out and helping your community getting the things done right in a good manner wayBroad-spectrum entertainment for our families and friends to to have fun and active in the community.I love watching all my favorite songs and videos on YouTube premium. I think more people should use YouTube every day. I believe YouTube is going to be our future soon to helping people in our communityYouTube Highlights:- one day I was heading over to my uncles house to put a new tire on the drivers side of the car. I was only 16 I didnt know what to do. So I watched a YouTube video about putting new tires on a car. YouTube was a cool way of showing me how to put a tire on a car. I gotten the tire on the care properly with no mistakes and hesitations. Because YouTube guided my way through all of the important steps on how to fix or put a new tire on my uncles car without being responsible of getting anyone hurt.I saved my uncle some money I also got good brownie points from my grandma so YouTube made me feel important in the moment I was helping my uncle out with a new tire.YouTube Lowlights:I believe YouTube opens up there self to allow people to share their stories, and their videos to every one on YouTube. I think thats not a smart thing to do, some people have absolutely no respect for others on YouTube and post too much drama, negativity, and animosity Their are kids on YouTube all the time. I dont think most civilized people who have children like their children to be listening to songs and watching inappropriate videos. Excellent example more kids in our community and in school are having - sex - using drugs - and hurting other people with weapons... I believe that the majority of all the violence in our daily lives in our communities. Are caused from some people sharing their videos of songs with drugs, and profanity, and wepons is getting our youth into trouble and hurt. I dont think its appropriate at all for YouTube, to allow people to post any negative things on YouTube and videos I dont think that people that are being negative on you to that are you tubers should lose their YouTube account but I believe that there should be a higher standard set for their guidelines there instructions that they signed over to you to become a YouTuber.? YouTube Think that YouTube is a great resource for people in the community in our society to use to better and have it hurt me to do socially and better and he is our kids in the future to open their self-worth and perform activities like reading and learning how to use things by watching YouTube videos that are appropriately none of the negativity or any of the drugs and weapons sex unless youre over the age of 18 it should be a site for kids under 18 that has a limited security policy so they cant see nerve of the negative negativity or animosity...Sunday; June 21.

"Used to be better. Once I liked you tube and had my own page to post videos and watch, save or download them. Now greed has taken over and you have to pay to download, you get plagued with adverts and like most social media you have to watch what you say or do. YouTube is in league with google and can track you or share your data with little or no consent or unaware consent. Also the copyright laws are stupid and you cant upload certain music or films, you could at one time get free films or music but now its just a greedy money making racket like the rest of this cruel money driven insane world banning everything and taking away freedoms bit by bit or charging for the littlest enjoyment. Also I am in my 40s and I was recently asked to prove my age by providing details, I dont wish to provide the details given to watch adult rated content, you tube and google are too nosy and invade peoples privacy rights. Fair enough its to stop someone young watching the wrong stuff but I grew up in the late 70s and 80s and the tv was different then and it was up to parents what we watched and I never knew it to harm anyone.I remade my you tube and just watch survival, archery or some music videos. Not the same as it was and it seems to be getting much crapier.I dont like technology these days, I dont like phones that track peoples location and invade privacy or when you consent to cookies or sharing data, if you ever read it it sends your details to hundreds of companies which in turn can use your data how they want and even sell your data, then you get spammed to bits.Technology seems to be used against us these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, I could pay YouTube to make that less overwhelming.  I would also would like YouTube to take a real accountability on the content they share on their platform.  Regardless of what YouTube is doing on this subject (bare minimum until now), they clearly and publicly admitted that they dont think it is their problem.  In the name of Freedom and more importantly cost savings and avoiding any legal problem (bottom line no accountability), YouTube is managing this topic very carefully with the objective to not have to deal with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"YouTube uses the app to control and manipulate people. As many or most people are aware, YouTube will frequently censor, de-monetize, and delete the accounts of content creators that offer differing opinions from that of YouTubes owners.One good example is content relating to the coronavirus.You can present legitimate scientific studies that disagree with what the CDCs or WHOs statements of the day are, and your video may likely be censored, and possibly your account suspended or deleted. You will get a generic message from YouTube about \violating community guidelines\""
Fiddles of Freedom. YouTube as well on its way to restricting free speech. When YouTube was invented I was so happy. I thought YouTube and Google was the greatest thing ever invented in the world.

"Marketer-creative & innovative thinker. Ive spent months in searching specific topics which would help me understand different experiences and business aspects. Ive been watching few particular Influencers, just to evaluate what this new type of approach is all about. YouTube channel has facilitated me access to information and ideas which obviously sometimes reading about, doesnt really reflect the reality of things. What Im interested in is the strategic focus people have, strategy development and implementation, business development and inter-related processes. Let me just highlight something about these topics. The theory highlights the methodology and the research process which involves learning and complexity theories, no matter what we read about. When we get into actually watching what a reading process would involve or see the practical side of a research project, we get to evaluate how it feels to be in that position to be innovative and address changes. So, to me personally YouTube complements the reading process with the practicality view, which in my case is missing. I wouldnt recommend YouTube to allow disruptive behaviour or attitude and false statements people make to create money. Ive watched few people and Im totally embarrassed and ashamed this information goes online to fill in the gap. This is something I dont agree with. I understand the freedom of expression and I totally agree with it, but I dont agree with the nonsense people are posting for a financial purpose and this is discrediting the YouTube image extremely.. the value proposition in an information promoted and provided through this communication channel must be reached in quality not quantity, evaluations, investigations, data analysis of what this information purpose is also triggering to reflect and not impact the life in a negative manner. We dont need YouTube channels to be full of fake information and this is something I struggle to understand why is this permissible when the actual content should be so different and innovative and informative as well. Lets not pretend you dont know whats happening, you need to address these significant concerns and issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censored. I love the content. But I hate the fact that Google and YouTube censor political ideas contrary to your own. Let viewers decide.

"Dont agree with certain philosophies from Google. First, I dont like that Google is a liberal company and actively sensor conservative sites and videos.  Dont like how they have to interrupt the video with an ad Im not going to purchase anything from.  Put them at the beginning and the end and always allow me to skip . If there was another option, I would switch in a heartbeat  There are many great people on here and Im appreciative of the ability to watch a video and learn something new.  I just am not a fan of how they decide who stays and who goes.  Obviously if something inappropriate is going on such as well violence or bullying, I agree it should be stopped.  But to take someone off because they dont get any ad revenue is a bit like Big Brother  And I dont feel advertising revenue should be the focus, its supposed to be a platform of sharing and educating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You guys are ruining the complete experience that YouTube was founded on. You are driving away customers, all because of what? Money? Sad. As if you arent wealthy enough. Google, YouTube CEO, and whomever else has decision making abilities; you are what is wrong with the Internet. Do better. Be better. Listen to your consumers, or risk it all for someone like me to find something better, or one day even make something better. Its starting to become inevitable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENSORSHIP. YouTube is censoring freedom of speech and sharing of information. It is NOT your (YouTubes) responsibility to decide what information we the public receive It is our own responsibility to take in all the available information and decide what is relevant for ourselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prioritization of Ads Over Creators. YouTubes annoying pop-up finally prompted me to write this review. Be careful what you wish for, Google.Before the company bought YouTube, it was wonderful. However, Google does all it can to placate corporations at the expense of creators. Its business model centers on exploiting the talent of creators as the company automatically places ads on videos made by even small creators without allowing those creators to earn money from the ads (a creator now needs a minimum of 1,000 followers and so many watch hours and views before they can monetize their videos). In other words, a creator can put creative energy, money, and time into their videos without getting anything in return unless the creator gets funding from another source. Yet Google earns millions (billions?) of dollars in ad revenue for content it didnt even create often without sharing a dime with the very people who generate that money for them. Additionally, regarding news and politics, YouTubes algorithm recommends videos from authoritative (read, corporate) sources even though the majority of the videos I watch are from demonstrably more trustworthy independent sources. YouTube has openly stated it recommends those authoritative sources while deprioritizing independent sources despite the fact that corporate news outlets get the news wrong all the time or, worse, cover stories in a way that placates their advertisers. And goodness forbid a creator speaks one word challenging the status quo or uses a word Googles advertisers dont like. The algorithm will immediately demonetize the video or take it down altogether. The name YouTube used to make sense because it was about You, the creator. But, as with everything else, corporations invaded a once- independent platform in the name of prioritizing profits over people. Big surprise. How about this, Google? Rename the platform to CorporateTube. At least then youd have a modicum of a redeeming quality once known as honesty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom OF Speech. Make sure YouTube keep Freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immoral use of data. Google has a complete disregard for the privacy of their users. They are taking advantage of the ubiquity of their product to misuse data collected by their own algorithm and from other online sources to increase viewing time. I&#39;m tired of seeing video recommendations that are clearly based on my activities all over the internet. It&#39;s creepy and invasive, and you know it. Shame on you.Also, the app has started automatically removing a great many comments with specific words or phrases, many of which over seemingly arbitrary, innocuous things that virtually nobody would be offended by. Its really irritating trying to figure out how to phrase something objectively harmless that might set off their idiotic censorship bot. On top of that, the user gets no notification about removal or record of the comment, so any long messages youve put a lot of thought into simply vanish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Security and privacy. YouTube is a great app and you can get information very easily and quickly.  Just have some security and privacy concern after 18th May 2018 regarding GDP act.  Who can get my data (search history, location history etc.?This is main question and nobody like to share his location history or search history to any body or organisation. I think its a crime to share your privacy to any organisation or anybody with out your permission. Otherwise YouTube is great app and I love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship of free speech. Avoid YouTube if you believe in freedom and freedom of speech. YouTube is censoring many ideas and discussions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube CENSORSHIP. Change the Corporate Policy to FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION of all ideas and viewpoints. The People are capable of figuring out what they want to know and how they want to know it. Knowing right &amp; wrong are built in to all normal humans if &amp; when they are FULLY informed. Get to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Starting censoring content. You Google going after anything they want and you all will be next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One honest opinion. YouTube Should not abuse its power to sensor peoples freedom of speech just because it is not aline with its political ideology.  It not only does so to regular US citizens but also to their President Trump.  You has raised my distrust and doubt on the integrity of your company.  I will switch to other social platforms once I find other options in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hate what YouTube has become. YouTube used to be such an innocent app, that people would just freely do wholesome videos on  Now, its turned into something completely different.  First, the animal abuse.  I think most of us now know, what horrible things people have done to animals on YouTube for views.  This is mainly because views = money.  YouTube monetizes these videos, but demonizes a video with the word Crap in it??  This may be because YouTube gets most of their money from the horrible content, such as animal abuse.  This to me is sickening.  YouTube used to be such a great app, but now because of this, its not.  I really wish YouTube would actually LOOK AT THE REPORTS, and add a ANIMAL ABUSE REPORT on the report tab.  YouTube favors money over actual things lives.  There was one video I saw on YouTube, where they force a puppy to mate with an older dog.  You can already imagine how horrible that is.  And yet another one, where someone was hurting a kitten just to get views and pretend he saved it.  Why would YouTube allow this?  Because most of the creators care more about being rich than actual things lives.  THIS IS WHY THEY ARE LOSING USERS.Another thing I hate - Content Farms.  Some of you know what this is, but some of you do not.  Ill explain it.  Content farms are basically 20 or more channels that all post the same things, and are run by the same people.  Why do people do this?  We go back to the money.  Views = money.  So, multiple YouTube accounts means more views, whichs means more money  The worst part?  These people dont even put a lot of work into their videos, they just re-upload past videos to make it seem like they added new ones.  Its basically a cycle, where they constantly just re-upload old videos on the other accounts, and their own account.  Take the YouTube account Master Cakes for example.  If youve seen their videos, youve likely seen other accounts that post almost exactly the same things on their videos  Other accounts that are run by the same people that run Master Cakes are Easy Plus, Mr. Chef, Master Chef, Mr. Cakes, etc.  You get the point.  Something else thats horrible about this also?  Its putting the people that actually dont have content farms, and work hard for their videos out of business  Everyone is starting to go to the content farms, so the real people dont get any views, which makes there no point to upload  So if you dont want your favorite YouTuber to go out of business, dont give the content farms what they want.  YOUTUBE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.  I really hope YouTube sees this, and gets the message.  Please dont be selfish YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the world of mobile, this app is a miscarriage of ethics to the user. But this is Google, which is notorious for being anti-consumer and its abuses of privacy. Among a litany of anti-consumer functions in this app, Ill name a few big-ticket items that are particularly glaring: No Picture in Picture option, even if you pay for premium. Likely because this forces users to stay within the environment; every ad dollar squeezed to the maximum. Default to low-resolution video. This is totally backhanded and likely a tactic to save bandwidth for users on limited data plans so more ads can be viewed. You are screwing your consumers by doing this. Period. The recent update further obscured bandwidth usage by eliminating the resolution options with vague descriptions intended to keep users using minimal bandwidth to allow more room for ads. And yes, the ads. Everybody hates YouTubes ad practices. Theyre invasive and aggressive. Paying the premium will alleviate this, but the interface remains structured entirely to keeping the user contained in the environment and from dividing their attention to other content in their device while using YouTube. Users, beware the permissions this app requires. An alternate option is to just run the mobile web page and better protect your privacy. This app is puritanical and invasive. I come for the content, and hate this app and company for everything else it stands for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some instances, YouTube can be argued to be contributing to the moral, and social decay of our societies by not having more control over content. This is just my opinion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Other than the obviously immoral and exploitative use of user data by Google generally, my primary complaint is with their censorship and demonetization practices. The app automatically deletes comments with specific words or phrases, many of which over seemingly arbitrary, innocuous things that virtually nobody would be offended by, or which fail to account for context/intent. Its really irritating trying to figure out how to phrase something objectively harmlessly that might set off their idiotic and excessive censorship bot. On top of that, the user gets no notification about removal or record of the comment, so any long messages youve put a lot of thought into simply vanish. Ive also noticed comments being shadowbanned, meaning essentially deleted, but viewable by the user alone. I dont understand how these kinds of deceptive and unnecessary practices can possibly be justified.Literally the only reason I continue to use Youtube is that they have monopolized the space. If a real competitor were to show up with good content creators and a community that isnt stifled by advertisers, I would HAPPILY jump ship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without censorship that leaves everyone to there own free will to decide what is wholesome, right, wrong, moral. It is this free will that our creator gave each of us. I have looked at thousands of YouTube videos on how to do certain things, I have had to learn to distinguish between what works and what doesnt work.

Freedom of Speech. Sorry Youtube - I love you guys but I am getting more and more concerned about hearing you guys cancelling peoples accounts because of their views and speech - Freedom of Speech is Freedom of ALL Speech - good or bad - take it from someone who comes from an old Communist country you dont want to go down this path - today you get rid of the hate speech but believe me it wont stop there - after you get rid of this speech today tomorrow you or someone else is going to want to get rid of some kind of "other" speech they find offensive until its gonna get to the point where all speech is gonna stop because everybody out there is gonna become scared to say anything because someone out there is gonna find it offensive or wrong - the only way to have a truly free society is to have truly free speech of all kind - it is this freedom of speech that allowed Youtube to become one of the best and most loved platforms out there because people came to your site because they believed they could get real truthful honest information about anything and everything from this world but if you guys start censoring content on your site I might stop coming to you guys because how can I be sure I'm getting the best and most honest and full information that's out there - that should be for me to decide not you - and also think about this - if you start censoring some people today someone might come along tomorrow and start censoring you because they will say they don't like what you are saying - the same way I'm sure you wouldn't like that to happen to you is same reason you shouldn't do that to other people - I'm writing all this to you guys not to get into a fight with you Im doing it for 2 reasons- 1). Because as a Citizen of this country I have an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights which includes the Freedom of Speech and 2). As someone who loves Youtube I want to help and protect you guys from going down the wrong path the same way I would help or protect a good friend of mine or family member who I saw going down the wrong path and felt it was my duty as as their good friend or family member to help them get back on the right path and vice versa - if you guys feel differently please let me know- the only way we can work all these thing out is to talk them out freely openly and honestly and the only way to do that is to have Freedom of Speech - Thanks for letting me share my thoughts and views with you as only I could in a country with free speech haha instead of punishing me for it.KD"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been appalled at the number of videos posted from reputable and knowledgeable sources that I myself have shared with others that get taken down by YouTube as soon as the sharing goes viral because they deem the information harmful and dangerous.  If they were just a private entity then they can endorse whatever views they want. But they are part of Google, a publicly traded company which has essentially gained a monopoly over the transmission of all things online.  That makes their censorship of free speech unconstitutional and illegal. I hope they stop this practice on their own or face legal consequences.  Shame on them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Censorship. Its the biggest and really the only reason I gave YouTube a single star. I am a firm believer in the first amendment, which guarantees the rights for all not just a select few.Companies like goggle, Facebook, Twitter and even YouTube have a responsibility to our U.S. Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights. These platforms were created for the American citizens of the United States.  As a user myself, political favors, political pressure, political corruption should have never been part of the development &amp; creation of social media sites.Foolishly perhaps we (or all) who use these sites to share our views should NEVER be censored for our views. I always thought these social media sites were intended for we the people, not for venues to turn social media sites into a charade with a hidden agenda or motivation to discredit those who voice their message via typed comments of a particular topic, whether it be politics, religion or take a position on various issues.Sadly what was once thought of as good is now being used for evil Very disappointed in those who monitor and control the contents of media sites and censor something they are in disagreement, simply for power over the masses and for favors exchanged for evil intentions. In the end the result will prove to be disastrous for those who daily walk about with a hardened heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why would you waste advertising dollers showing me something i cant even use?  Also most me comments get deleted seconds after posting. Maybe because they don&#39;t comply with their alphabet agenda.

Dont they know wikipedia can have fake sources and edited by anyone?I changed info on wiki before putting false info once for fun(years ago).

Their hammer lock on web video is being distilled and will be broken by its growing field of competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I am increasingly amazed by YouTubes  frequent attacks on free speech and the sharing of information. The political posturing of YouTube and its unwarranted and unwelcome forays into gross censorship is going to eventually alienate your users.  People are already turning to alternative sites for information. If YouTube insist on this suicidal tactic you will reap the reward of extinction which will be thoroughly deserved. YouTube should be independent and not politically driven. Wake up before it is too late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Youtubes Behavior. The only thing that I do not like about youtube is how they treat their people who give the uploads. Youtube is constantly penalizing those in who do not agree with the agendas of US policies or those who do not necessarily disagree but show an opposing view. As we know truth can be subjective. As with the Covid 19 agendas for pushing mRNA vaccines, it can be life saving or the reason someone whose body chemistry is not compatible for the vaccine will either dieor become severely disabled. There are documented cases in the hundreds of thousands worldwide, there are also hundreds of thousands not documented. If we only allow the pros of the mRNA vaccines to be spoke aboutand not the cons them not only is truth subjective it becomes a half truth. The USA has a nasty habit of covering up injustices, medical malpractices, racism; etc, until there is an explosions of emotion that becomes overwhelming and action starts. The US Gov believes that if youtube controls content outside of their narrative this will control what people hear, see, or know. This is not true. Long before Youtube or the internet people have found  ways to spread their truth. By Youtube becoming a part of the US narrative and withholding information and truth from the public, it makes Youtube an accomplice to these injustices. People will find other ways to spread the truth and in evidently not trust YouTube with the content of truth. The people will create their own mega site were they can speak their truth in how they see it  and youtube will be out of the picture. Freedom of speech is a constitutional right in the USA and when your business becomes a fact of spreading speech then, In my opinion the Constitution must be followed. People should not be penalized for their speech. If the speech is content another person does mot like then there are plenty of channels they can turn to.I am not saying it os okay to attack people who make certain comments. All comments should be respectful there can be a little cursing but nothing too strong attacking the commentor because this will lead to stalking or less views; etc. But debate is healthy and help people as a whole to become critical thinkers. I think it is a shame Youtube gets involved in the subject content that is not  pornography, theft, murder, violence or is not directly life threatening. Telling the truth about a vaccine or the need thereof is not the job pf YouTube and if you decide to intervene then you would need the pro vaccine, the anti vaccine and the medically not able to use vaccine doctors and scientist, otherwise you should use a disclaimer like television programmers stating this is not necessarily the view of Youtube and keep it moving. Stop penalizing the people who allow you to make money this is communism and has no place in the USA. They are making money for you because people are watching and commenting on their uploads so you in-turn should pay them. These are not your views, at Youtube, it is theirs and that is the point of all types of people watching and listening. I you better believe if people are looking listening to natural approaches it is because they want to and they are looking for it. The people who blame QAnon for their behaviors are lying. They were looking for someone who thought like them. I saw QAnon many times and I did not change my beliefs to some of the crazy crap he was saying. Somethings were true, but truth is subjective and it was not my truth. As adults we have to be able to discern what we need to know, filter through and discard the crap. The only needs to be the caption that this is entertainment and not necessarily the views of youtube, viewer discretion advised. must be 21 or older or something like that  But Youtube as a platform should not be a part of gov suppression because them youtube becomes the enemy of the people. Do not let gov entities mess with your money because their goal is to make you dependent on them and their contracts them they can control the original dream the creators of youtube had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh, and i forgot to mention the abomination that is Youtube Kids. But that story is for another time. If you are reading this when COVID-19 is gone, then good for you, you cant relate to me. If google is reading this, bring back the gone videos. Bring back the deleted accounts. Or everyone will move to Bing or Yahoo. Not to mention the fact that there is a literal GUARANTEED AD at the end of every video, making it impossible to change videos conveniently on phone and ENTIRELY REMOVING video changing on TV and computer.

They reduce features on videos for kids so that they can claim theyre fighting child abuse.  They demonetize and repress videos that contain views they disagree with or opinions that are slightly controversial.  They create an echo chamber in recommendations.

If I spend my time on YouTube, YouTube makes money. Varying opinions, perspectives, and experiences culminate into our inherent value to each other. Its ok to disagree. Finding common grounds, in uncommon places cultivates growth for all. If everyone is to be respected, as should the variability of all as individuals.

When these video informations are no longer of free speech, YouTube is now acting as a Big Brother.  Let the content of the videos be freed, and let me choose what is good or bad to watch.  It is ashamed that YouTube now decides what I can/cannot view",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube Sensors free Speech. YouTube has demonetized many, they have pulled down true videos to promote their own views as positive truth. YouTube has made it hard for start up news to succeed. In America we are Free, bound by a constitution created by founders that broke away from the control of elites like the ones that control Twitter and YouTube. America needs to fight against this control and we need to have an avenue of expression that is open and free and YouTube unfortunately is all we have at the moment that is easy to use and that is it in a nut shell, thats all they have easy to use Once somebody comes up with an application that stores videos with no control over content that is easy to use YouTube will be a thing of the past",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why are u censoring youtube? why are u working as a surveillance arm of the government?. i love youtube but there are a lot more ads now and u are clearly censoring a lot of content and also preventing certain videos from gaining more airplay due to their content with ur suspect covid algorithms. i also am appalled at the connections between youtube and intelligence gathering agencies that are violating our privacies and the greater implications for what this means to our democratic freedoms and how youtube may end up being another eye and arm of the global totalitarian security state.Please change back to how things were before u were in league with unlawful data collection, or i will stop watching youtube and you will surely be sorry at such a huge loss such an important supporter such as myself.- Tom Hanks, lifelong fan and supporter of PALSS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop the propaganda.. allow freedom of speech. YouTube has filtered content and no longer allows people to post their independent thoughts. They have stopped conspiracy and some truths from being added. Toooo many commercials All the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google sells your data for millions  f them. They also censor anything thats truth.  Every Google App will get a 1 star from me  every time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"many things mane. first of all its the youtube kids infiltration for me. like i cant even watch a dumb video from my childhood without some features being blocked to protect the children.. why would kids videos need protection when theres a million inappropriate videos they can watch at any time. theres a whole yt kids app, its not our fault parents dont know how to raise their children. ALSO stop deleting views from BTS music videos ok bye",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google suppression. What else do you demonetize, Google?  Suppressing voters, maybe?Big nose, its ruined your legitimacy. My trust in Googles impartiality is gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You let the world down. Shadowbans, removing dislike button, hiding comments, censoring speech and ideas, deleting creators content while promoting establishment propaganda, sad what YouTube has become.. the internet use to allow the free flow of knowledge, give unrestricted access to all the ideas of the world  ..now it is just a tool of the oppressors..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ads, ads, and more ads. The user experience of YouTube is going down the drain as the company focuses on a freemium profit model. The whole app is just nothing but ads. Ads in the videos, ads beneath the videos, you even have to tap on a button just to hide the ads to get to a videos comments.Ive noticed YouTube has stopped updating their app ever since Apple made it mandatory to report user privacy information in the App Store. YouTube wont be required to publish that information until their next update, so theyre being totally opaque about how your information is being used. Typical of an untrustworthy monopolistic big tech company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Too many ads and censoring opinions. YouTube now sees itself as the arbiter of what you should see. Time for alternative platforms to maintain freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blocking free speech. I avoid google products whenever possible. Google/YouTube believe they know what is best for us - we do not. Arrogant twenty somethings blocking content. Outrageous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Stop censoring information. People need to stop being sheep and do research on their own and take everything they hear with a grain of salt. Social media should not interfere with information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube is ran by communists. Freedom of speech is no more.  YouTube sensors and removes videos they feel are harmful to people when in reality the content  does not fit their agenda. It is completely one sided (Democrat). Google should be destroyed  completely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The politics of algorithms and private space. At some point, its inescapable that platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are a part of the global commons. Much of the content on YouTube is incredible. Ive learned more through my inquiries on this platform than I have through any medium Ive encountered since I left grad school. It is, however, inappropriate for private platforms to have too much influence over content, censorship, and any other considerations as it relates to freedom of expression. I appreciate what YouTube has offered, but there are clear instances where YouTube fails in what it chooses to sensor, as well as how its algorithms are constructed, pushing certain dispositional agendas. Its important to note that the solution here is not simply rooted in the first amendment or the US. Rather, as I suggested earlier, how freedom of expression, freedom of the press, etc. is negotiated must be renegotiated in the public spaces on the newly emerging transnational and potentially global public spaces. For now I do embrace YouTube in its present form, but there are clear concerns, as enumerated by commentators like Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, the new left, and the new right. Some of the critiques are spurious and sophomoric. Others are substantial, and we cannot afford to dismiss them. Ironically, once history gains traction, it cannot be stopped. As institutions like YouTube curb certain veins of expression, newly emerging transnational and potentially global spheres emerge through dialectical m枚bius twists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop spamming us with Youtube is at risk banners. Google and Youtube are multi-billion dollar companies. If youre unhappy with a law Im sure you can pay for lobbyists. Keep providing a good customer and consumer experience rather than distracting us with things we didnt ask for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Internet freedom. Stop tracking my information and profiteering off of it. Way too many adds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Stop censoring content. YouTube is a beacon of knowledge and it has changed my life. However, it is someones right to watch anything they please. Even if the information is false it is their right to consume it. Stop the censorship. If you do, your platform will leap into even farther success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Love YouTube but. Its way too democratically centered, people deserve to have fair equal information for the public to consume.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another One Bites the Dust. YouTube has decided it is their divine right to control political and social narratives. This goes beyond keeping users safe, as they publicly support one-sided politics and routine demonetize creators who disagree with YouTubes corporate or political structure. Added to this is the double standard by which YouTube operates; they will demonetize channels as they see fit, yet will allow creators like Casey Niestat to advance hare-braned political ideas, and get paid for it. YouTube joins the ever-growing list of private entities who enforce their own version of rights and law, for public safety. Double-standards abound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They limit your freedom of speech. YouTube/google ban most content and mark it as extreme for no reason. Thus limiting your freedom of speech and expressing your opinion. This app is no longer reliable, they listen and record everything you say throughout your day and then advertise accordingly to get you to buy things you do not need. Its not YouTube anymore, this is Brain Washing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google is the worst. We need new human rights laws just to deal with Googles insane advertising.

These adverts should make you wonder if youre a tool or a person. Disgusting google",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube. YouTube should not be censoring so much. Stop being political and let other points of view out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom & Diversity. I like the ability to research a variety of subjects and to learn from others. YouTube allows Freedom and diversity in many of the subjects offered,However The greatest fault of YouTube is their narrow minded viewpoints when it is related to political topics that offer diverse opinions about the Political Narrative. YouTube does not and has had an iron hand in shutting down any videos or viewpoints that offer opinions that are not the same as the stronghold of those who own &amp; manage YouTube. They do not allow for diverse opinions on political topics. They only allow their Narrative to be shared. That goes against all Ideals of Freedom of Speech. We are only allowed to hear, share, or listen to political viewpoints that fits their belief system.  When there is no diverse ideas I n that respect they dont even deserve two stars. They have no respect for Freedom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech. Stop censoring the content of providers you disagree with under the guise of violating community standards.  I am disappointed YouTube does not embrace diversity of thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop the ruination. Every update since youtube was acquired by google has just made it worse. Greed is bad. Stop asking me to give you my data on multiple apps just so you can quadruple dip on selling it, youtube music YouTube YouTube premium youtube red etc, this is insane and completely unnecessary. And stop asking me to turn on notifications, if I want them on I will put them on. I do not need multiple banners asking me whenever I open a page It is bad enough posters ask on every video. Remove the stupid auto pause instead of keep making it shorter Do the job you are supposed to with complaints if they are not accurate then restore the video (supernatural anime from official channel lost sound cause of copyright claim but they did have copyright of it and it still was not restored years later, just as a an example.) stop with the over abundance of ads Absolutely none of your tactics make me want to give you anything, in fact not only do I not want that but many of your advertisers wind up loosing potential customers from all the aggressive ad practices. Not that any of this matters since consumer care is nonexistent in google and affiliates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring?. YouTube is now censoring accounts and banning them. This is unacceptable. We are allowed to have our own opinions and voices. We should be allowed to speak our minds and freely express ourselves. I remember when YouTube first started we could be individuals. We had fun. YouTube used to be great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like YouTube but. YouTube is great but they need to stop censoring freedom of speech no matter how ugly it may be cause truth and honesty and accountability will prevail and make society for the better. Reduce corruption and hold the global citizens accountable to moral ethics and for greater good for all. Those of you engage in ill will and misinformation will eventually be caught and justice brought to them. Net neutrality will weed out the corrupt cause entire world in the end wants peace and good for all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YouTube and censoring. Stop censoring stuff. Makes you look petty. And also Im sick of having to always start a video over because you started playing it before I even selected it to watch. The ads are horrible and I dont even watch them. Im here to watch videos people make that interest me. But understand your in it for profit and propaganda purposes now. Have a nice day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Premium Account and Freedom of Speech. First, I love the unsensorship of YouTube.  I love how they support our Freedoms and Liberty.  Second, YouTube is my go to for knowledge, education, and all the unknown Im researching.  Third, YouTube leads me to other resources required to accomplish and complete my researchs.  I pay for a premium account and recommend it to every YouTube viewer because it supports YouTube, our freedoms and those of others.  I resently stopped to take a good hard look at YouTube and the positive impact YouTube has on me and discovered a thumbs up  To sum it all up,  Lastly, YouTube has helped me in every area of my life.  It goes on and on. Thank you YouTube  I appreciate you folks and what you do, all together, you do good things for others as a service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTubes Self Sabotage. We have the greatest mass medium of all time, almost perfect, and the owners insist on attacking the one thing it all depends on - free human expression.Censorship is never justified without democratic oversight. The persistent propaganda over community guideline strikes, and the opaque obfuscation surrounding their function, leaves a deeply untrustworthy taste.Alternative platforms to replace YouTube are now necessary, and perhaps inevitable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quit suppressing freedom of expression and free speech. Look, I love YouTube but the fact YouTube/Google is actively involved with suppressing my freedom of expression/speech, freedom to Think,  by frivolously removing and/or blocking content or Banning users based purely on politics or ideology in general, your days at the top are limited. I understand limiting content that directly calls for violence or is the subject of extremely lewd and cruel torture, but hiding or banning content that doesnt present physical harm is ridiculous We the people have alternatives and are actively using other quickly growing platforms such as DuckDuckGo, BitChute, BrandNewTube, Parler and so on In the meantime, keep banning and removing content, when a tech tyrant does, I make it a point to see what the big fuss is all about;) just not on your platforms. See what Im saying? Not doing anything, people will still see what youre trying to hide ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Talk about targeted, everything. When I use this app I feel less and less secure everyday. Targeted ads, targeted channels, targets videos. Ewww, oh. Wait, its owned by Google.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A private sensor. The people who own this have taken upon himself to censor people. Very many times they take down factual videos and hurt real people by demonetizing them for no logical reason other than the fact that their politics may disagree with the politics that YouTube wants to portray. Their fact checkers are often wrong and they are opposing freedom of speech of the Internet should represent. Such things only help communist countries like China and hurt America and other democracies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censored searches. Seems like YouTube and google wont allow content they view is conservative or sometimes results are totally invalid to manipulate the thinking of users. YouTube and google are practicing social engineering. As bad as fake news. More subversive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censor?. part of Google heard all about how censorship is part of this companys practices which Im sure since they own YouTube they do it as well. This was a platform where we could all voice our opinions. Now I see how those that own/ operate doesnt matter, but now I know. I absolutely loved YouTube so much that I rarely watched anything else. I am now actively looking at replacements. Hope everyone else does too, these people should not be influencing our elections like slivering snakes all shady, our politics shouldnt be decided by biased snakes. Sincerely,Soon to be EX YouTube fan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Important. YouTube is the place to be for almost anything, information is important, entertainment is great. But its not 5 star because of the new algorithms, recommended videos, and the idea of demonitizing or taking down videos because someone hurt their feelings. Age restrictions already existPorn isnt allowed obviously Copyright issues is fairly established But punishing anyone because of language and edgy visuals shouldnt be taken down. YouTube should recognize the right to freedom of  SPEECH AND EXPRESSION, not everything should be censored, it shouldve been left alone from the start.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube should pay you for your data. I really enjoy YouTube, however its rather sneaky that google is mining user data and selling it to advertisers. It really galls me that they dont pay me anything in return for selling my data to unknown clients. They are making billions of dollars in the dark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do not like YouTubes ability to sensor everything. Like most people Fed up with censorship stop your censorship Now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep it free like America. But if you start censoring things, youll lose those who support you, love YouTube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The True purpose of the internet. YouTube is the best thing that is on the the internet. Its an awesome library of everything you can think of. I have YouTube premium and it is well worth the $15/ month. Drop the extra cable channels you never watch instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good, but has MANY downsides. I use this app a lot, and I think it&#39;s a good one to use, but things NEED to change, as well as some things that have to STOP changing.1. Lots of the advertisements that pop up in the app aren&#39;t personalized, even after changing ad settings on google accounts.This can lead to some both disgusting and unsettling results.2. The &#34;Manual review&#34; thing is a total lie. It&#39;s all done by bots, as demonstrated by the constant malfunctions, as well as information given from programming experts that look inside of the website&#39;s code.3. The recommended page should be more directed to the user and NOT towards current trends. There are lots of people that complain about Among Us videos being in their page all the time, even after selecting the &#34;not interested&#34; option.4. Ads should stop showing up on the platform if a majority of users don&#39;t want to see them. There are lots of ads like &#34;this helps fix bad breath&#34; and show thumbnails that can be really unappetizing.5. Lots of buttons in the app have very small hitboxes/activation areas that can be hard to tap on and can be missed, thus taking the user to a place that they don&#39;t want to be. This goes along with issue 4.6. The UI changes WAY too often, resulting in users becoming unfamiliar with certain functions and becoming confused with certain options. A fix for this is to have a little text box when an update has been made that adds a certain function/button.7. STOP. CHANGING. THE. LOCATION. OF. THE. COMMENTS. SECTION.8. If you want to celebrate smaller &#39;tubers, stop screwing them over. Lots of users get banned without reason, and a majority of those users are small ones.Please fix these issues ASAP.

"Censoring. Censoring people with different ideas from that of YouTube is anti-American. Defunding people because of different ideas is anti-American. Do better, YouTube. You let all kinds of trash happen there, but the second someone speaks any truth or different ideas you demonetize and unravel their platform. Ive unsubscribed from your monthly service and have no plans to use it until you stop censoring people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Down the drain. YouTube use to be a wonderful platform for real raw source of information now its filled with ADS ADS ADS and censorship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unethical business practices. YouTube violates me as a consumer by censoring videos that have differing opinions than the YouTube overlords. This is unethical. YouTube does not have a monopoly on truth and I dont think they should be involved in such practices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Incessant Ads, Very Little Content. Now that they have a brand to exploit with a captive user base, time has come to monetize it.The proportion of ads, especially during election time is shocking. If you pause and restart, that is a signal to show more ads, because you just indicated you are paying attention and are right there. Good content is ruined when they show ads in between and after every few minutes, even in interviews when people are mid-sentence. Unbelievably invasive and out of control. Never voting for these losers that are targeting us with political ads. Google, we know what to expect from them. Nothing unusual here. Privacy is a castle in the air, the way they track your data across their different platforms, especially Google Maps. One day, hoping Apple Maps will catch up and we can ditch them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship at its finest. Stop censoring your own creators and allow on journalists to report the news. Stop protecting sexual predators on your platform and silencing victims and journalists. The level of censorship on this platform is outrageous. There are literal children being exploited on your website and youre more concerned with silencing reporters and channels who want to speak out. Disgusting, truly. Words like: predator and rape, should not be censored because they may be referencing newsworthy information. It sounds like YouTube is more concerned with silencing its creators, than addressing the real issue of child exploitation and predatorial behavior on their platform. Shame on you, this is setting a very frightening example for future social media platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ugh. Youtube is a nice platform and I appreciate it a lot. There are a few things I have a problem with that really affect my experience though:1. Ads.Do you think I want to see 4,000 Donald Trump ads in one day? NoAlso, Ive been getting too many ads from a YouTube channel called Classically Abby that I have blocked many times; however, Youtube just wont quit bombarding me with her videos. I dont like her channel I dont even watch anything remotely close to stuff like that Ive blocked her channel and Im still getting ads??? Im sure other people are having the same problem, so please look into this. (I wish there was a way to block peoples content FOR GOOD, thanks.)It would be cool if viewers could somehow pick Ads theyre interested in. Youtubers would get more money then as well due to the viewers interest in the ads.2. Variety.I would like it more if on the home page there werent so many videos recommended of the Youtubers Im already subscribed to. I can easily see these videos by going over to my subscribed list3. Youtubers themselves.There are many Youtubers who have made videos in the past which are inappropriate (just in general, not just to children) or offensive. For example: Shane Dawson has made many videos involving blackface, predatory behavior towards children, and has mentioned sexual endeavors with animals. I dont think anybody should find this funny all of his old content was either disgusting or offensive in some way and all of it should have been demonetized. I dont care how old the videos were; they are still viewable. And since hes a Youtuber with so many subscribers literally any person (including children) could have access to his old videos. So, I believe you should focus on older videos as well. YouTube has been an app Ive had for so many years I would appreciate if you took these ideas into consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censoring. This platform must end the political bias against those of which the moderators/ administrators disagree with. YouTube is profiting from clicks and hits on demonetized content. Demonetized creators that bring users to the site should be compensated as most users view other content that is monetized. YouTube should profit off of its creators for the use of the platform but they need to properly compensate the creators that bring users to the platform. YouTubes bias and greed is causing content to leave the platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shame on you YouTube. Censoring people and hiding dislikes on YouTube is disgusting. People have the right to know the truth and when that truth is hidden people get misled. Its a shame that big corporations think they have the power to control people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Spying and advertisement at it\'s best app. Wow, not only does Google (owner of YouTube) doesn\'t care about people\'s privacy, as their whole company and products are design for the collection and sales of people\'s personal information, but they don\'t like criticism. My review of their lousy YouTube app keeps disappearing. Youtube used to be a good platform. That was until Google took over. Now it has more ads than an advertisement agency. Google took a great idea and flushed it down the toilet with their excessive ads. Ad after ad after ad. They should change it\'s name from Youtube to AdTube. At the same time, I am thankful that they have let their greed take over. The excessive ads have pushed me to stop using it as much as I once did. I have cut my use of the app by about 90%. Hey Google, you really need to cut back on ads. In forums around the net people are talking about how YT has been ruined by the excessive ads. Don\'t you already make enough money from all the spying you do on us? When it comes to tour app, you can\'t even put out a half decent app. The thing keeps freezing when I try to put a commend. Or if I start typing a commend and then disregard it It gets stuck there. The app needs to be closed and restarted or I have to go to notes and click on a saved link to a YT video, that opens the appa and gets it unstuck. This have been going on for years. You still haven\'t fixed it. So come on, all the spying, all the ads.. And go ahead and delete my review again. No problem, I am copying and pasting this one. To repost it and call you out on the advertisement if needed. Oh, I forgot to mention, the latest and greatest from YT, now unless you give them your phone number they block you from logging into your account. Had to reinstall the YT app and when I tried to log back in it would not let me do it unless I gave them my phone number. What a load of you know what. Seriously Google/YT, seriously I am glad I hardly use it anymore. Thousands of people are complaining about this abuse from Google. It seems that a lot of people do not want Google to have our numbers. So this is what I did and suggest. Install ad blockers and VPN in your devices that block Google, Facebook, Amazon and others from tracking and spaying on you. Also look for alternative platforms to use. I have not used their search engine for well over 10 years. If I do by accident, like a site directs me, I exit the site and right away delete all cookies and data from my browser. Ad blockers and VPN that hide your IP address and work great. Its a small way to pay them back for blocking me from my YT account for not providing them with my number. Hey, its only fair. If I dont use your lousy products, you do NOT deserve to track me or spy on me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Community and Rules. First of all, when YouTube was created, it was meant to be a platform where many individuals could share their talents and hobbies to the public and how they feel. This created the anarchy system we have today that you guys are ruining. Ever since more children started using YouTube, it has been losing the touch it had many years ago. The reason why most people dont like or follow your guidelines is because the community established their own.For example: If a person on YouTube does something bad, there is a category of other YouTube that will bring the problem to attention and the rest of the community will teach that person a lesson. However, with you present guidelines, it makes it impossible to stop other YouTubers from doing bad things, and your algorithm isnt doing anything either. Its like your indirectly protecting the terrible people on YouTube. Thank you if you read this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube really has fallen. This used to be a good platform. However, it started to go downhill a lot.First off, Google has a weird habit of rearranging things on the app. For example, they moved the comment section for no specific reason, and it is very annoying. I would rather have 100 splinters in my hand than see the new comment section.Second, COPPA has ruined YouTube. For some reason, even though YouTube Kids exists and YouTube is not made for kids, they are making YouTube creators responsible for making sure their content is showing wether it is or is not made for kids. Bots are also falsely marking a lot of videos for kids, and miniplayer is turned off on videos marked for kids for no good reason.Third, a lot of YouTubers are getting demonetized for the pettiest reasons, such as saying a word that is not even a curse word, such as coronavirus. Fourth, they straight up LIE about personalized ads. I turned personalized ads off, but there were still ads that were based off of my browsing history. When I clicked on the information button, it said otherwise, but everyone knows that it is a lie.Fifth, they allow scam ads. When you go on the home page, you will often see scams that are taking up adspace. These scams include free money, free gift cards, unlimited free subscriptions, etc. Its surprising how YouTube allows that.Sixth, Google/YouTube never listens to the customer No matter the outcry, no matter the better ideas by the community, YouTube always picks the worst ideas.There are many other reasons YouTube is the worst, and these are just a few of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Google is evil. YouTube would get five stars if it was still independent. Google wants your data just like Facebook and all the other garbage dystopian companies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The changes and censorship of YouTube. At one point in time YouTube took the place of tv for me. Now the people that I once followed have been deleted the ones that remain have to censor themselves to stay. I dont watch near as much and most likely will stop all together because its gone down hill fast. Its a shame that in a free country with free speech people cant watch what they want. I also would like to point out that safety and hate has nothing to do with the censorship because I have seen the absolute trash that has been allowed to remain on this site and it makes me sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restricting free speech is not Right. YouTube is too busy restricting information than promoting it. By restricting information you limit an individuals personal right to evaluate the information they are given by both sides. It is a shame that Im watching YouTube less and less because of it. I dont wish to be told what to think and its completely un-American.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ads and censorship. If corporations didnt play such a huge role in controlling google and YouTube gotta get paid though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship of valid material. Im over it. Do not want to use YouTube when important political and social views are being censored and deleted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfair censoring. This use to be a great resource but now is like all the other crooked Big Tech companies.  For some reason they think we need to be told what we can watch or believe.  The Censoring is out of hand.  Censor the crimes and fights and porn as it should be.  Dont treat us like children.  There will come a day when YouTube is no more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5* Censorship = 1* Experience. Why are Google and YouTube working so hard to hide/censor the truth about election fraud in 2020?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Censorship. I enjoy watching a lot of YouTube videos, but I do not like how YouTube censors and shadow band creators for silly little things. This is especially annoying when it happens while there are creators on this platform who will harm animals while getting paid for it. Heres an idea, Report, ban and censor that instead of people who do next to nothing or something that other creators do and get away with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Evil Censorship. Big Tech should not be the final arbiters of truth. This space is ripe for disruption for a free speech alternative. Google should be broken up and heavily regulated to prevent their left-wing dystopia from growing further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube use to be better. YouTube sensors videos for no reason and turns off comments for kids videos yet lets the fake life hacks that are dangerous are recommended, somethings wrong with YouTube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube censorship. I use this app as little as possible. Really unhappy to see Google-owned YouTube censoring the truth and censoring content, just like parent company Google and Twitter and Facebook. This whole effort to keep the truth from people is going to be addressed after President Donald Trump resumes his Presidency. Im hoping for huge fines for abuse of public trust by all of those corporations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spyware. Clearly, Google is spying on my internet searches and then regurgitating YouTube videos to me based on their espionage.  I do not appreciate their intrusion into my privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Tsk tsk tsk YouTube. Pretty dumb to start censoring people for posting factual data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censorship. Im so tired of finding YouTube videos and channels deleted. The founders of youtube got rich off of our freedoms in this country and now you are denying your customers freedom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube is good except for deplatforming, demonetizing, and censorship. You are not the United States government, you are not God, you are not an elected official, you do not have the privilege to censure, even if you do have power. Using that power to squelch conservative voices you do not like us wrong. Thankfully, other companies are opening up, with better technology, so the American public can then censor you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You guys need regulations. Free content from whatever source is really damaging our country and the world. Ask for regulations. Vote candidates that support it. YouTube should be no differently regulated than a CNN or any other news outlet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free Speech. Every one is entitled to clean freedom of speech no matter what your religion race or political view. So stop censoring different  view points. I will make up my own mind for my self, not YouTube thinking for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. I use YouTube for many things, but I am HIGHLY dissatisfied with the increasing censorship that goes on here.  Shame on Google, very bad company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Un-secure for kids. Its a really good app and all but sometimes kids just cant keep there hands to them selves and then ask there parents to make accounts for them and it is willingly accepted for an unknown reason. So the whole 17+ thing, yeah. It does not really effect anything. Kids get into streams and comments and steal stuff from other people and somehow get so many views and likes and there is literally no description and no effort. I get that kids are likely to just record stuff and then upload it and give NO credit to the creator. Example: Someone made an animation that became VERY popular and was re uploaded by other people, and of course they gave credit, one person however did not. Do you see where Im going with this? My point is that YouTube should remove stolen videos that do not give ANY credit. Which by the way if you didnt know is illegal. Yep. If you upload something that was somebody elses with NO permission and no credit given and you claim it: it is illegal. You should have removed those videos and reported them. And if I am correct you are allowing these kids to steal peoples animations and all that stuff. Also I really dont know why but in videos that contain cuss words and inappropriate none kid friendly things it never warns you about it. So if you click on something it might contain stuff like that. Some people have even said the f word throughout almost all of the video. Its just horrible. Ive experienced some games that dont pay attention to there players and just make fake report systems for show in case cops or whatever starts investigating there game. But this one this one is the worst out of them all and this app has a fake report button. Just for show. And a lot of the comments contain cuss words so if a parent decides to report the creator for not deleting the comments it would not work. Its just horrible. You know that kids are everywhere in YouTube, and they put there FACE on YouTube. I get that this is what YouTube kids was meant for but kids these days will just delete YouTube kids and than download YouTube, and before there parents know it they will have created an account. You should start taking control of your app before it gets to messy and you will eventually have to just shut YouTube down. Now your probably thinking to your self DUDE you should expect people to upload stuff like that and yes I do expect things like that but some things are a little bit to bad. These days people will leave a review going off on me for not expecting whats in the app. And I think I am gonna leave it at that for now because I already know that some idiot is gonna disagree with me and stupidly right a review and start some kind of argument. Basically just dont get it and dont make an account for your child. It will allow him/her to leave ANY kind of comment and subscribe to ANYONE so be careful when you click something. Thanks For Taking In Your Time To Read My Review. Have a Great Day/Night",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Annoying spyware and adware. Everything about YouTube is all about data collection, offering up click bate rather than valuable content, serving up frequent countless annoying ads, and constantly nagging you to give Google your money for their premium services enabling them to collect even more personalized data. Look into Dtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc. and avoid Googles annoying offering whenever possible. With each change Google makes it just gets worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube censorship. YouTube is google. They censor the videos we watch. Ive been watching videos and they cut out parts of the video that youtube feels we the people shouldnt hear. Its time for us Americans to stand up and get our country back. Legally and peacefully. To not act like the terrorist thats called antifa and blm. God bless America and you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who needs a 1st Amendment anyway?. The content I find on YouTube is great. But the vague guidelines for what is allowed and the arbitrary enforcement is subjective and seems to be pushing the agenda that Google/YouTube want you to hear. Its a private company and can make all the rules they want, but the day I find a platform that hosts a large amount of unrestricted opinions, is the day every last Google product is deleted. You track our phones, our browser histories, and who knows what else. Just let me hear from real people and their opinions without you deleting their content because you dont like it or demonetize channels with 1 million+ subscribers because they dont toe the line. Shame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We want our freedom back. YouTube not have right to shut PEOPLE down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political and social censorship. YouTube, google, and the lot of these giant tech companiesQuite obviously do not believe their ideas are good, so any differing opinions out there (politically, policy, world view) are often times censored by the media giants. I have no respect for this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Getting steadily worse. I have no idea how Google managed to get away with monetising content that literally belongs to the world but they seem to have done it and the service we have had for over a decade is suffering massively as a result, with an ever increasing number of intrusive adverts and a really patchy service, with videos freezing when you pause them to do other things, often forcing an app restart, or even disappearing altogether after 10 mins or so.  It is literally a shadow of its former self and I refuse to pay money to one of the richest, tax dodging corporations on the planet so that I can watch content that has been created by us   Its like going to a public art gallery and paying someone to get out of the way of the pictures.Edit:  One year on and its even worse as far as the adverts go.  I know that Google long ago ceased to become anything other than a data mining outfit, and its products are all designed for this purpose alone, but YT used to be a window to the world, and now its just a corporate junk pile of irrelevant ads repeated ad infinitum every time I just want to watch a 10 minute video.  In these ten minutes I can expect to see up to seven ads now, which just make me hate the experience more and more.  I LOVE the content (which has nothing at all to do with Google), but forcing us all into a situation where we have to pay about half as much as our monthly broadband bill, or put up with endless intrusive ads, is not just reprehensible,  it should actually be illegal, and would be in any decent and sane societyTL;DR?YouTube under Google has become  an ugly, corporate shell of what it was and if it carries on in this way I give it five years tops before a rival company gets enough market share to ensure YouTube is nothing but a bad memory.  Cant wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stupid double standards. This is a pretty big flaw so minus 2 stars for this: but you need to line up your creator filtering and ad filtering. There are some people who get blacklisted or deleted for mildly adult content while ads on here have thirst traps and people being forcibly taken advantage of, but its ok, because thats just stupid mobile game ads, right? No, its the people who have the power to stop them that are the problems. You have YouTube kids, stop being so money hungry and change up your policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Censorship is not a right that belongs to Google YouTube or Twitter.  Free speech is what this nation was founded on and the free ability to exchange ideas.  The Tech companies have more than abused this basic right.  Stop it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For youtube. Dont like what you are doing with I dont trust you, my privacy. You pick and choose who has a voice, decide what contentdont trust you I can see and stifle I free speech. The only reason I use youtube is I hate TV I do not trust you, it is obvious you support the extreme left and their agenda. You support communism and that is not American. You take people off your Chanel when they tell the truth. I hope you get yours when the time comes, I believe you will.and what I see on it more. Now that I have said this I believe youtube is going to mess with me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Youtube likes to censor the truth to push mainstreem propaganda. They are getting to be just as bad as google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So much for Freedom. Of. Speech. Wow, YouTube went down the pipes. So much for content that everyone can enjoy. Now you\'re censoring things that don\'t \align\ with your partners. Smh""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Purposeful  obfuscation. Unable to measure public-determined quality of video and or content due to the inability to see dislikes. The blatant protection of share holder interests and government propaganda is appalling, YouTube has been hijacked by profitable agendas and anti-science oligarchs hellbent on destroying competitive thought. You will not succeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep it up. YouTube makes people life easier ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consorship. YouTube is not the best social media platform. They started this downhill journey by collecting our personal data and using it for their own agendas and ads and AI behavioural data collection. They live and breath personal data collection. Youtube encourages extremists and extremism by limiting our access to info that doesn&#39;t challenge our opinions but rather push us to the extreme. We saw that clearly during the trump era and we still see it trough white supremacy groups.Youtube has showed time and time again a bias when it come to dealing with my fellow Muslim and Arab community. Censoring content thats very relevant to our causes. Their pro-Israeli approach was clear in the event that are happening recently in Palestine and Gaza. Blocking content that show the Israeli gov. War crimes and horror attacks against the Palestinian civilians. Limiting the access to posts and videos about the subject represents limiting  free speech rights. I cant wait for a better alternative app that protects my personal information and opinion and respect free speech rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Have some morals. Demonetizing, censorship and pushing of false corporate narratives has ruined YouTube. Creating an open form, free speech platform and then attempting to control the flow of information and knowledge once the platform has the lions share of the audience is nothing short of betrayal to your customers and the individual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good. Could be better without censorship. Nice video sharing platform. Unfortunately Google / YouTube are tools of the corporate imperial police surveillance state. They peddle propaganda and silence dissent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Censorship. We all know, you can suppress all you want but youtube is selling its soul.  I do love Youtube, in my opinion the greatest thing ever, however having political videos censor should not happen. Youtube needs to be real news.  Trump won",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STOP CENSORING FREE SPEECH. Let the people decide what they want to see on YouTube stop shadow banning free speech and demonetizing channels. Americans are intelligent enough to handle information on the internet STOP BEING PART OF THE BIG BROTHER NANNY STATE Dont tread on me and my rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let me use my own stuff. The ads in the middle of videos aside from everywhere else are one thing, but you really wont let me choose the private browser I already have installed for external links instead of a Google-owned option I dont want on my phone? It doesnt even let you copy them. Simple fact guys. If I dont use your browser, Im probably not going to use it, so forcing that option is pretty narcissistic. YouTubes political demonization issues are enough without them not letting you use YOUR OWN PHONE the way YOU want to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. I have loved YouTube for years. I just hope it will stop censoring people with different ideas that try to have their voices in the public square.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 ads every 3 minutes? Way too much. Age verification? Lol yeah yeah. 2 ads run every 3 minutes forcing you to lose any concentration u had on what u were watching. Google picking pockets left and right. Money from ads money from views money from subscriptions its no longer a streaming service its a money collecting machine its way too annoying to ever consider joining to end all that nonsense. In a 1 hour long video youre now on expected to watch around 40 ads.Also the age verification thingy where they ask for a credit card or ID, weirdly enough this happens when I try to watch videos criticizing certain corrupt governments, making me feel fairly certain my details will end up with that same gov. So its not enough YouTube is censoring what you can see or say, robbing you blind at every turn, bombarding you with forced ads every 3 minutes. Collecting and selling your personal data, but now YouTube is playing Israeli Pegasus style game with your personal data, and going as far as trying to verify your identity for certain not really age related material. You can watch a murder without this age verification,  but get near certain governments and anyone criticizing them, and you risk having YouTube handing you over on a silver platter. Some of these age verified restricted videos work when I use vpn, meaning theyre intentionally fishing for the identity verification for viewers in certain locations, rather than being really about age as falsely claimed by YouTube. Now google is nothing but another Facebook. Try BRAVE browser, zero ads, much better privacy, and free, you can actually make money on BRAVE if you CHOOSE to watch ads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censorship. YouTube is caving to political and corporate pressure. This should be just a media platform not selecting information that they deem appropriate. Grown freedom loving adults should have a choice in what they see. If you dont want to see something dont watch or have a disclaimer for snowflakes who cant cope or except differing views. There are too many ads on here as well. There are too many apps who there everyones rich and can pay for everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I like the way YouTube is set up and the way it is user friendly but I dont agree with all the censoring of free speech  We Americans want the truth and an avenue to get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Stop censoring, you know what you are doing YouTube. You will bite the dust as a business if you continue this blatant nonsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should be a free public service. Lots of great (and mediocre too) content.  In their quest for ever more profits Google is making the ad interruptions ever more annoying (because $10 billion in profit a month just isnt enough right?).  I also worry about a huge corporation with profit motive and political affiliations being in a position to censure free speech.  YouTube is (or at least was) a terrific service but its time to replace it with something better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censorship. Google and YouTube are controlled by pure evil globalist Marxist that want to enslave humanity. Need to break them free of monopoly globalist control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Censorship. Always wanting to censor everything Shutting my account soon and moving to another platform. DO NOT LIKE CENSORSHIP YouTube has became trash.Do better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Ive lost many people to follow because YouTube decides what the content should be shared. I dont agree with the amount of times YouTube decides to take down great USA Patriots, but will push info on the toxic jab full of graphene oxide. YouTube owners are globalists, not Patriots",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bloated and unfriendly. This used to be much more user-friendly and accessible. Now every video is locked behind unskippable ads (and sometimes interrupted by them as well) which continue to get longer with every update. The algorithm constantly feeds you whats popular instead of what youre interested in, to the extent that you can pinpoint comments from people whove been recommended a video on the same day as you. Even if youre subscribed to a channel, you might not see their videos anywhere in your feed unless you subject yourself to push notifications.They do almost nothing to moderate their worst users, allowing all sorts of harmful content and comments while wilfully imposing random strikes and shadow bans on users whove done nothing wrong (generally because theyre not creating traditional content that generates revenue for Google).And they trick you into feeding advertisers more insights into your behaviour through quick surveys that pinpoint your buying habits and make it even easier for them to disrupt your experience on the platform. If there was another viable platform for video content, thats where Id be. Google is one of the least morally sound companies on the planet right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its okay. YouTube is a good app, without YouTube wed be bored out of our minds and most likely broke ._. ANYWAYS- some people- well me cause Im dumb, deleted YouTube for storage ( your probably wheezing your face off ) and I think you shouldnt need a lot of storage for YouTube, some people dont have storage so there probably looking through a window thinking of what to do. Im not saying YouTube is amazing chefs kiss or bad what the frick do u think your doing-  its close to amazing it just needs a few things... to be fixed-  ( aNYwAyS.  ) a lot of people get annoyed/irritated by this cause there probably on a computer or a iPad not at home with Wi-Fi and they cant connect to a hotspot. SADLY . ( aka me ) and when they get on YouTube it says  your not connected to the internet  Me: * throws iPad across space * ( not littarly) I just really dont have WiFi at times where I want to watch Bts stick figures getting stuck in roblox games and playing roblox of course- ANYWAYS back on our topic. I also think that u should make creating accounts easier like for example if your 9 or something and your an orphan living in a house alone ( somehow ) it asks get your parents help ... ITS HARD FOR THEM. You should probably just have to put a password for your channel and a name. it should be as easy as that. I dont mean any hate or anything.. its just an idea for an update thatll make people like YouTube even more from 1000 % to atleast 5000000000000 % you feel me?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of speech. Aye everyone knows that theres always been mean people online, since theres a kids version I expect normal YouTube, especially with an optional account for someone thats over 18 years of age there should be now holds barred. Dont like what someone says online? Boo hoo go touch grass the world doesnt revolve around your ego or the internet in general, you can at least look away or find something else of the infinite options there are.

1st Amendment. This is The most useful Internet application I use. I am seriously concerned about Googles lack of respect for differing opinions and blatant censorship violations. Please lay off and stop biting the hand that fed your opportunity to exist. Dont let your politics snd greed destroy such a beautiful creation. Please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Removing Videos. I dont like hearing content creators and seeing YouTube videos removed because it doesnt coincide with authoritative news sources or a particular political perspective. I would prefer to see and hear the best and worst opinions so I can determine what they are for myself. You cant be for free speech when you dont allow the freedom of that speech. If the creator isnt inciting violence then the content should remain unopposed. I hope more reasonable minds prevail amongst the staff at YouTube and Google. Trust that most of your customers dont trust your site and are only using it because of the monopoly it holds in the market place at this moment.I encourage who ever is reading this to consider that censorship takes away the individual\'s ability to talk through the issues that need to be discussed. If people are not allowed to talk through controversy then ideas are expressed in other less desirable forms that do not involve reasonable modes of communication.Thats a basic understanding of history.For these reasons my Premium account will expire next month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube censors political videos. I dont like how YouTube censors certain political videos but keeps other ones up . Its obvious its controlled like the media but the great thing bout the internet is that people will still find the truth and facts and spread the information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. There is a lot of censorship going on at YouTube And YouTube had to be called out for letting pedophiles make time stamps on young childrens videos, but they delete videos of those who give out truthful information, that anyone can try and find for themselves online, before its erased from there too YouTube also owned by Google, censor information Thanks Sundar, for selling out ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your censoring of important information is BS. I enjoyed YouTube when I had the freedom to watch what I wanted. I am not enjoying YouTube now because it is acting as if we the viewers are kids and need a parent to decide what is appropriate or not. Your attempts to stop and censor information makes me more thirsty for it. So I will find alternatives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censoring people. Google and YouTube need to stop the communist totalitarian practice of censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube is going downhill. Don't get me wrong, I still love YouTube. Itjust has some problems right now that areabsolutely unacceptable.1. YouTube music now won't let me downloadJocelyn Flores or Depression and Obsessionby XXXTENTACION, and I'm sure there's other songs too. This is NOT acceptable. Whenever I try to download them, it say Unplayable and whenever I play them""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much censorship. This platform use to be free and fun. When Google took over it has become about making money and not about freedom and all  about censorship. A society cant grow if it cant experiment and have the liberties to express itself. Once again the greed for money has corrupted the freedoms and liberties of creative people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Treating content creators like dirt. 1) You take advertising revenue away from the best channels.2) You still show ads on demonitized videos, effectively stealing from the content creators. 3) Automated copyright algorithms take down videos that fall under fair use and theres no real people at youtube to talk to about this.4) Constantly advertising your subscription service. I dont support platforms that fail to pay and bully their content creators.Google/YouTube are getting far too greedy. It is not a complaint about content makers at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fine app, disgusting company. I hate YouTube, I love the content and the creators. What bugs me is the sheer amount of ads and scummy practices. Ads are so intrusive its hard to use the app, it requires near constant attention and babysitting just to finish a video. Gone are the days of letting a video play while you do some dishes or walk the dog. Back to back ads play multiple times in the middle of videos. Meaning you gotta stop what your doing, find your device, pray you even CAN skip the ads, then finally skip the ad and continue what you were doing. This happens multiple times per video, on every video. Its not enough to watch 2 at the beginning and end, no they gotta squeeze as much cash as possible out of your 7 minute experience. Ads also bar you from searching for another vid or clicking away, it completely blocks off the other videos unless you watch the ads or restart the entire app. The actual content of the ads is even worse, political content including topics like police brutality and misogynistic ads aimed at men. A good chunk of the ads are for mobile games, not only do they actually lie about the content they often use sexually explicit characters and sounds. Literal moaning and butt cheeks on screen is way too far. These can appear on any type of video, even without an account youll see these ads. Im scared to even use this app in public, but Im more concerned about even watching a Minecraft video with my 4 year old cousin because at every turn, YouTube shoves disgusting advertisements in her face.Another issue is the blocking feature, when I block a channel, that means I never want to see their content. I shouldnt be allowed to visit their channel or have it even appear to me. But for whatever reason thats not the case, YouTube channels Ive had blocked for months still pop up in my recommended videos. Ive blocked these accounts I truly dont understand why Im still seeing their content.It feels like every part of this app was made just to squeeze cash out of users and make it as frustrating as possible just to watch a 3 minute video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why?. Why do I have to download a kids YouTube for privacy thats not needed Im 19 and I dont have kids I want to watch videos swipe it down to continue to listen and search for another video why does it have to be difficult youtube like what the heck.But also its my account that I have had for a long time why cant I even change the privacy on my own account its not an option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Easily replaceable. The only thing that keeps youtube afloat is the many different creators. However, even a monkey can make a competitor to YouTube and make it more obsolete than MySpace. Where do I start? YouTube, like all major platforms, has a clear and cut liberal bias. Implementing strikes and bans to anyone under the guise of terms and conditions. A channel can be striked, demonetized, or deleted at any moment under the broad umbrella of violation of our terms and conditions. Not just content creators but just regular users. Dare to have a conversation in the comments? Good luck. YouTube can deem anything as hate and delete you in an instant, all the while not being able to give you a clear example of said hate.Freedom of speech is allowed as long as its acceptable speech. As long as said speech further pushes the agenda of the elites. The ones who fund YouTube, mainstream media, and social platforms. Next, YouTube has a serious issue with spam and misleading ads. As well as unskippable ads and ads in between. Spam ads are typically those of mobile games and accounts that post their terrible mobile game 100 times, so every time you, the user, tell youtube you do not want to see that specific ad, YouTubes algorithm will eventually give you the same but not the same ad. Its an abuse of the system, and such channels should not be allowed. These mobile games are made by scum and use YouTube with misleading and sometimes copyright-infringing ads constantly. There are false ads claiming to giveaway a product with fake accounts in the comments claiming the giveaway to be true. On the topic of algorithms, YouTube loves to think it can just recommend new things. I spent months curating my feed to include channels I want to see and watch. Eventually, YouTube will recommend channels I have absolutely no interest in with no prior search history on the subject or channels I can not stand that I have to tell YouTube not to recommend to me again. The feature to not recommend an ad or channel is busted. It eventually will show the channel or video or ad again or replace it with a similar video, channel, or ad. Its obnoxious and borderline frustrating. I dont want to see mango tree grown from seed or wood carving. If I want to see a specific topic on YouTube, Im very much capable of searching it up myself. If there is a particular channel I want to know, I will find it myself. Sometimes YouTubes algorithm will recommend a good channel or video or music; Im not saying its incapable of doing so, but for every 500+ channels or videos YouTube recommends, will you find a channel or video you like. Next, the decision to remove comments, blocking the commenting feature entirely and removing the dislike numbers. YouTube is swift to protect subjects it deeply cares about. Protecting creators that need it from the big bad dislike button. You cant even comment on the White Houses official channel. How insane is it that in 2022 the White Houses channel has to be shielded from comments? Theres no room for a discussion on YouTube. Theres only room for compliance.How about another disturbing feature that YouTube recommends vaccine awareness videos. YouTube is actively promoting and encouraging, whether passively or actively, people to be vaccinated. Its scary to think that a company will take such a stand on a personal matter. Not to mention YouTube actively promotes pundits who will mock people who are unvaccinated. Labeling such people as stupid or uneducated. When a majority of the US is vaccinated or naturally immune, YouTube continues to feed content that belittles anyone who is not vaccinated. This type of content is dangerous, especially to people who can not receive the vaccination due to medical conditions. YouTube encourages a culture where it is ok to yell, talk down on, outcast, and possibly harass and assault someone who cant be vaccinated or who isnt wearing a mask for 2 seconds as they eat. YouTube can be demolished by a competitor easily and if a competitor were to address the issues of outlined, many creators will have no issue jumping platforms. Just like many creators became streamers because YouTube cares very little about certain creators; like gamers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost exclusively use youtube for entertainment and learning new things. If we could get youtube to stop censoring and/or demonetizing so many things because of political agendas it would be perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Preserve history. I enjoy YouTube very much. Ive been able to learn so many skills and life lessons (for FREE) on this platform that it has been truly life changing. There is something, though, that I find very disturbing that has happened with YouTube: Deplatforming and Censorship. There have been many times when I went to find a video and discovered that it was removed for being what was considered by some anonymous over-sensitive and under-educated person(s) as offensive and/or a violation of YouTubes Terms of Service due to someones arbitrary OPINION. Opinions are uniquely individual and subjective ideas or assumptions that are NOT universally accepted or rejected. By removing content or adding disclaimers to content where one has to go through inconvenient added steps to access it, YouTube forces its own ideas or assumptions (opinions) upon the users and denies the content producer as well as their intended viewers the right to express and form their OWN opinions or the right to come to their own understanding of the content. YouTube is not our PARENTS or POLICEMEN, and has no right to dictate or direct the formation of users thoughts or characters or deny the free expression of such while being an open, public forum. If YouTube wishes to control or prohibit content, then YouTube would have to be a private, paid subscription with a selective user community.Adding disclaimers to video content, the same way the film industry does, is really the only appropriate method of alerting users to potentially offensive or disturbing content. REMOVING content without consent of the producer of it is illegal censorship and a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, as well as destruction of valuable historical evidence. In conclusion, I hope the anti-trust cases against the monopolization of these formats is resolved successfully and that open and free platforms for FREE and UNFETTERED SPEECH will prevail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all the years I enjoyed YouTube and its ability to provide entertainment, I find myself realizing youre no different than the rest of the MSM and their efforts - like the Nazis in WWII to sensor, burn and remove anything that didnt suit their purpose.  You never removed the videos of the flat earthers. You never removed the pornography. You never removed the videos of anti-vaxxers or videos of outright propaganda.  No. It is very clear what youve become a part of and as a proud American citizen, I find todays news of YouTube removing any videos of fraudulent news pertaining to the election offensive.  Far as Im concerned you can go the way of Facebook and Twitter.

"Mr Nick. YouTube is a fantastic working platform, but Im very concerned that the You is progressively &amp; often automatically is being taken from the Tube. Please do not censor content that is termed controversial or labelled conspiracy theory. I have used YouTube for many years, even from the beginning &amp; for several years when it didnt have any commercials. These advertisements have become more &amp; more, &amp; have become an annoyance, but can accept them, as I realise this is how the channel makes money. But what I dont like is what Im seeing &amp; hearing: individuals like Alex Jones or David Icke being censored &amp; altogether banned, algorithms hiding content &amp; removing it &amp; so forth. Essentially I dont like how expressions or opinions are getting silenced. This is the silencing of the masses, of freedom of speech, &amp; is draconian. Please dont control the views of your patrons by demonetising them &amp; removing their content. If you continue promoting one view, people will simply with time bypass YouTube &amp; one day it will become irrelevant.. like mainstream TV is becoming. Keep this platform free, respect freedom of speech within the parameters of the rules- dont ban videos just because you dont like what they say. And ignore being pressured by big business or the elite to do so, or risk extinction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So let me repeat myself, why expect YouTube for example to become the safest site of the internet if you keep condemning and censoring the most righteous man and his followers. The answer is, NO, I do not think YouTube will ever be safe if you keep attempting to silence anyone who dares speak the truth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use it then lose it. YouTubes fascist censorship practices are horrifying.

To whom ever at YT that are making these judgments, they disrespect the concept of individual freedom and self expression and for this should be ashamed of themselves.

What gives Youtube the right to decide what topics and words can be spoken by US citizens??? Choosing what information is accessible to the public is a powerful tool of manipulation. The censorship on this platform is unacceptable. Many of my favorite channels have been deleted. You guy at Youtube should understand you will lose users, like myself, and become obsolete if you continue down the path of censorship and attempting to sway public opinion on important topics. I love the concept of Youtube, but I am very close to switching to other similar platforms only because of the censorship issue. I have no other complaints than censorship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Youtube is garbage. The censorship is completely out of hand yet they still get treated like a public utility and not like an editorial. The Google team has chosen to position itself as an enemy to liberty and free speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need to fix censoring or restricting hateful content. YouTubers need to make a living even when they go against the WHO. This should be a community decision and not based on how much money you can make on advertisements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Big set back. Randomly deletes youtube accounts of creators without reason. Is biased with its policies and who they affect and when they choose to enforce them. Almost all content on YouTube is forced to be extremely kid friendly.The content made is soooooooo cushioned by YouTube. For instance this is a pick and copy video platform. Almost everything can be copy written or claimed by someone else or taken down for policy violation. YouTube has outgrown its own purpose. Which was a free platform for people to upload funny, cool, new, interesting and un-tampered videos that were allowed to go outside the normal box and scope of television. Unfortunately, nothing great lasts forever and now I see more ads on YouTube than I do on tv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias and censorship. Stop censoring your videos and being so bias your liberal agenda is going to ruin YouTube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Highly unethical and moronic app development. Between the way Google force ads down your throat and the way they reset your app settings as to keep you on Autoplay no matter how many times you turn it off, and then Google removing videos by peer-reviewed experts I definitely feel this app should be ILLEGAL until Google address some serious ethical issues. I would highly encourage everyone to seek alternative means to support your favourite content creators. And also encourage everyone to write their MPs and MLAs to put the choker on Googles greed and narcissism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of speech. YouTube needs to be a None Political view that shouldnt take sides, l agree you need standards but you also should have a right to watch Like Sky News that was banned by YouTube for reporting the truth backed by fact, people of the World to read and see the truth.Even with the Election held in the USA the Mainstream Media was very clear what side they pushed for, then you had Facebook Twitter also banning what they wanted or didnt like which again is a disgrace to hide the truth.Love the wide range you have on YouTube to see News from all over the World History you name you can see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Online safety. Some of the you tubers who try to promote online safety are getting there videos taken down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The thing about YouTube that I hate is ads and I put 4 stars because ads so everything else good. Okay I just want you to be sure you dont want anything censored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Harassing ads that violate googles policy for a better internet. Ads at the start of every video, not one but two ads and will probably increase to 3 or even 4 very soon, im seeing a lot of ads dotted 5 throughout the video in which the content creator has denied adding, these are becoming very obnoxious and its very anti-consumer to be harassing users like this. It makes youtube a very non user friendly service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of speech. Stop gassing youtubers just because the present facts from the cdc,who,government that contradicts YouTubes liberal narrative Freedom of speech for all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too Much Censorship and Too Many Ads. Remember how awesome YouTube was before it sold out to Google? It has been getting worse ever since. There are algorithms in place to CONTROL what they want and dont want us to see. An Orwellian number of videos and channels have been getting deleted, and ads are worse than ever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Update an improvement. YoutuberI was wondering do you guys planning on adding a feature were if your account been hacked . You can transfer your data to your new email. Or a feature were u can transfer your data like all the people you subscribe to an playlist u made to your new YouTube account so u can keep everything. With out starting over . I noticed alot of hacking has been going on with YouTube lately and I feel people will appreciate it if y&#39;all add some new features that will let that  feel more secure. Like make a password or a boost of security update. Because I have been noticing that the hackers are going to people email accounts an deactivate there Google accounts and personal information by YouTube.So just wondering do you guys planning on boosting and fixing your security on YouTube so people can feel more secure I appreciate the help y&#39;all gave me on recovering my account. Y&#39;all should also add that on YouTube so people can fix things fast before deactivating there emails.I think you guysShould add the username and password feature because that wouldn&#39;t be connected to the person emailAn y&#39;all should fix the search feature because Everytime I look up a video nothing new pops up and y&#39;all have allot of sexual stuff popping upAnd every time I tap on a video that is not inappropriate it won&#39;t let me watch the video please make a update that fix the problem.An please fix the search results because when I type asmr a lot of users have playlist with porn in it an some inappropriate stuff just pop up in search results. ? For some reason an the restriction mode need a fix were when I watch normal videos it either not let me watch them when theres not inappropriate or wont let me comment....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harassing. Harassing viewers with lots of ads - why? You already make your money selling our data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Youtube - the totalitarian media. Youtube has appointed itself the manager of what Americans can see and watch apparently because they think we are incapable for determining this for ourselves. The only thing that qualifies youtube for such control and power is it being a huge corporation with lots of money, taken, by the way, from the same Americans they now want authority over.  Youtube is also protected from lawsuits because it claims to be a platform (for the public to express itself ) rather than a publication (subject to censorship of the publisher)???They prevent Americans from receiving vital information about diseases; the development of vaccines; election fraud; corrupt dealings of presidential candidates and their families.  Youtube does not want its viewers to have access to all information in order to make their own informed decisions - let youtube do your thinking for you they know best",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ads. Too many ads Its ridiculous how much money YouTube and google are making off forcing us to watch ads on content that was uploaded for free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and promoting main stream media lies. Well google has ruined youtube... intentionally. It is obvious to creators and their viewers. Youtube is now written its own demise. I hope you go to jail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too many Ads and censorship. Too many pointless adverts that I have no interest in. Not sure how they work their algorithms. Censorship of certain topics, ideas and political view points is actively happening on YouTube and is wrong. This is an attack on free speech and almost telling people what to think by withholding information. Apart from that YouTube is great Just wish they were more fair and less politically  biased in what they allow people to see on their platform :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube needs to stop removing videos that go against their beliefs. We, as individuals, can sort through information and make decisions for ourselves. More effort needs to be spent removing crimes committed and less energy spent on shutting down free speech from those who may have different views on politics, medicine and faith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quit censoring ppls posts and you will get a better rating. There has been such a push from your company about your policies. Especially when it comes to politics, YouTube. We dont need or care what you or your independent fact checkers think. Let people figure things out for themselves. It hints of your company covering up or concealing the actual truth. Why do we need YouTube to be our moral conscience?? Remember,  We the people...  its in our constitution as well as our bill of rights as American citizens. Quit infringing on our right to speak and communicate through the press. I thought that the purpose for your services on YouTube was for users who have an account to be able to publish anything  that they want and if people want to hear their content they get views and subscribers. How can you arbitrarily choose who gets to speak and who does not? Is this even a free country anymore?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship Central. Do you want Silicon Valley billionaires to tell you what you can watch? Do you want Susan Wojcicki to personally control each and every video you are allowed to watch? Do you want your important videos censored and taken down with no warning because they violate some vague term of service that is updated every 5 minutes? Do you want a video that is years old to trigger a YouTube strike on your account because of now violates their new censorship rules?Then YouTube is for you You lose all your rights as you have come to know them. Welcome to information cyber slavery. Thanks YouTube and Google.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube will take your FREEDOM. Want to see the truth CENSORED. Go to YouTube where the important news and Truth is removed so you can be controlled by their agenda to make you their controlled robot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad control. I love YouTube however, I am absolutely appalled that you have no control over who you allow to advertise on your platform. A high number of your advertising companies are fraudulent. I am writing this from personal experience. Im very disappointed about this issue, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lots of Content & Censorship. YouTube is a necessary evil with lots of content and lots of censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring content. 1 star because YouTube has a political agenda and is censoring content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
treat your creators better. i love so the genuine content on here but there is some problems. way too many people getting away with clickbait content and fake giveaways. you also need to treat your creators THE LITERAL PEOPLE WHO GET ADS ON YOUTUBE better. you demonetize them for no reason and say they cant create inappropriate content but then say they cant make kids content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our information is being corrupted. YouTube is by far the most popular video streaming platform on the internet. The reach that it has is wild - hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people rely on YouTube on a daily basis. Now heres whats scary: of the three ads I was served over the two videos I watched today, two had to do with media or politics. I saw:1) Donald Trumps campaign against Joe Biden2) The Epoch Times advertisementYouTube does not give you an option to silence these ads or dismiss them. Say what you want about Donald Trump - I dont like him nor do I want to see his political ads on my feed. Why cant I dismiss political ads?Now, The Epoch Times. This ads ethos was to convey the purity and lack of bias in The Epoch Times reporting, but a quick search on DuckDuckGo will show that this media outlet leans right and has a mixed record when it comes to factual reporting. It is YouTubes responsibility to give the consumer the right to dismiss certain types of advertising, especially when these ads serve the purpose of political indoctrination. I dont want political ads from either side. Is it that hard to ask? Or the option to silence them? YouTube is force feeding, if not allowing others to force feed us, information that may not be true or that has been sensationalized. This is highly concerning for democracy and our freedoms of expression. They get to choose what is released and what isnt.I guess YouTube recognizes its own power and relevancy in the lives of its consumers. Shame on you for misusing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep my comment. YouTube is connected with Google  it shares my data with four pages of Google company sponsors its like letting a stalker a rapist a paedophile in your house to take care of your children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop the censorship. The one and only reason most people use YouTube is to get vido verification on the information that they seek.  Its a way of hopefully NOT getting biased, censored and out of context information.  In the past 4 years this platform has turned into the same thing as CNN or NBC.   Without the cute weather persons.    Please stop blocking people from the platform.  If they have a sick twisted msg.  Well have a healthysensible   video popup after their bad one.  Humans will make the sane, safe and ethical decision in regards to their conduct if given all the facts available in certain situation. Know if you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube aka CensorTube. YouTube is great with a very big exception - CENSORSHIP of truth without justification.YouTube is Google-owned so anything that contradicts mainstream propaganda is taken down regardless of basis in verifiable fact.A new platform is needed - soon - mass migration will follow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Relax Censorship. It would be nice if there was more freedom as to what you can post.   YouTube is a great concept but the controls are to tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey I have some questions. Umm what are the developers doing to YouTube?We need some things to be fixed. Like whats with all the Trump ads?? Nobody wants to see them. At least let us be able to hide them because I cant stand them. They are everywhere And when you refresh the page, it just gives you another one Another thing, stop changing the designs First you did the comments, now you did the like/dislike buttons and everything. Nobody asked for it. Either change it back or stop changing them. Another thing, Dont get rid of the captions, thats really scummy to deaf/ disabled people and people who dont understand the language the video theyre watching is in. Also, whats with all the censorship and more kid-friendly content?? I know its old news but You made YouTube KIDS.  I understand you want to protect children and stuff but your app is rated 17+. IT IS RATED, 17+. Last time I checked, thats not for kids. Please dont mess up a good platform with kid friendly stuff, I would have gotten YouTube kids specifically if I wanted to see that. And one more thing, Dont shove YouTube premium in our faces just like you do with the ads. Both are ridiculous and repetitive. Like just chill with all of that. I understand its for money since your app is free, but cant we just enjoy watching content without 4 and 5 ads in one video? I really adore this app, Ive been using it since I was a little kid, I think everyone has. Now Im 16, and its a great way to pass time, learn something new, get information, and watch tutorials and d.i.ys, especially during quarantine, so please take time to look over your app and fix what we NEED you to fix, not what you THINK needs to be fixed or improved. Thanks YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transparency. YouTube should be transparent to the users the rules and regulations of determining bots and real human streaming. They should release a proper rules section for how they count views. Also deleting 98 millions views at once is unacceptable. YouTube should improve their system of detecting views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube needs to grow up & let people speak & listen without censoring. Stop taking down every video that says anything about covid or 5G that isnt the cookie cutter narrative from the mainstream media or the WHO. I thought you were better than this YouTube. So much for freedom of thought or speech or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App works great, but harvests too much personal info. The app functions all fine and well (except for transitioning to dark mode during use, but I can live with that). My problem is with the personal info it collects and retains for advertisers, despite my best efforts to curb this. I have a Google account that has zero personal information, not even my name. However my YouTube ads are still targeted all the way down to the county I live in, with no options to stop it. Im avoiding the app entirely as long as this practice remains in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey Google... dont lose touch with your consumers. Is it necessary....To have multiple ads between 3 minute videos?To have a pop up EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR STUPID SUBSCRIPTION?We all hate it... just let us watch our videos without Google trying to get in trying to make a few cents off of the ads that no one wants to seeIT IS EXCESSIVE Take a survey. Everyone agrees. No one wants to pay for your stupid YouTube subscription..... I believe in capitalism, but you have turned it into the red headed step child. I cannot wait until Google has actual competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My disgust with YouTube. You have taken down numerous sites that I relied upon for conservative news. You are censoring people. Your management should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Google and YouTube are doomed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too many ads and too much censorship. You guys at Google have ruined the internet. Youve made it a place where only partisan politics and socialist views are allowed. You even censor true crime videos but allow hateful left-leaning rhetoric and feeds. Im old enough to have grown in an era where we didnt have the internet. I suppose well come full circle and that censorship will push most non-political folks back to that way of living. Its too bad that we have to be treated like children. And the ads are so annoying now that I dont even open the app more than twice a week. Its just garbage now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"End protections. I would defend YouTube. But when your favorite content creators get demonetized, age restricted, and shadow banned. Im all for trumps legislation ending the protections of this platform. Tired of watching hard working people being bullied",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doing a lot of things wrong. YouTube isnt doing enough to stop the spread of misinformation, and also isnt doing enough to help spread beneficial information. Why havent you corralled your influencers to create content around testing and vaccines. You seem to be able to get them to do things to help YouTube You have a great opportunity here to generate some positive press for a Google owned entity but you dont see it. You just want the ad revenue from all the hate being spewed on your platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More big tech Censorship. They censor anyone they disagree with. Anyone who refuses to fall in line with the google group think has their pages taken down or their funding revoked. Theyve censored politicians, doctors, lawyers, not for lying but for telling the truth. YouTube is a danger to our way of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POOR values integrity and morals behind the comapny. Shame on you, for censoring honest and good people. The truth hurts only Youtube, precisely, they are NOT working for the people but their own low, and scummy agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ease of use. Its simpler than ever to use YouTube these days. Help menus. Its easy to load videos, edit comments, check notifications, save to playlists, have videos of interest presented, report the bad stuff( spam, etc), translation of comments, check analytics ( if you have the interest).  People have built transformative communities through the app. There is a vast array of education available. Items are being saved from landfills because of the repair videos, for example. Lives are saved by medical and nutritional lectures. Children can find help with school subjects.  People are learning each others languages and sharing their cultures.  Only drawback  the pointless  cen sor ship on certain topics. Its driving people to other platforms or at least splitting their time.  Not a wise move for the long term. Bad information just falls away by itself through exposure and  challenging discussion.  YouTube can have an interesting future, I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google is evil. Content is filtered so you are presented a false version of reality, advertisements are intrusive and exhausting, meaningful content creators are removed or silenced if they do not align to a specific dogmatic agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make safe for all. Make youtube better for all youtubers regardless  of sex or color and get rid of racist youtubers like chemicalstar #thebullyexposed #wearewatching thebullyexposed.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facists. YouTube abuses their power by quashing freedom of speech, I can think for myself I dont need you to decide for me what I can and what I cant watch, additionally you treat a large portion of the population as if theyre stupid and unable to decide for themselves if something is right or wrong, everything should go into the public arena to be debated and debunked if it is spouting lies, but you must give people the right to choose for themselves what they digest, the truth always comes to the surface eventually no matter how hard you try to hide it and you will reap what you sow if you continue down this slippery path of censorship, throughout history there has been many dictatorial regimes who had to start somewhere and required players to aid and abet their desires for power and forcible suppression, if this doesnt sound familiar to you take a look in the mirror but thankfully eventually they all come crashing down, and I feel YouTube is one of a number of organisations who are helping on this journey to an eventual dictatorship. If you think your current actions are improving the service you offer you are being woefully misled. I used to be an advocate for YouTube but unfortunately I find myself constantly criticising you and other big tech companies for your current adolescent behaviour and find that the majority if not all the people I talk with tend to agree with my concerns.Now is the time for you to show some courage and return to the original values of YouTube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad company. Google only wants your info to make more money and censor what you can watch not actually provide anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy invasion. Thanks Google for selling my private information to advertisers, truly loving that my address, email, mobile number and location (as well as many other PII) is sold to the highest bidder.Google, Facebook and others like them are a scourge on this planet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Why is youtube controlling people I wanna see and removing contrast is important to me and millions of others  feel they are no longer American,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. though i enjoy the content of youtube. i find it difficult to agree with the ethics of deleting millions of views from creators who have worked long and hard and who have millions of subscribers. there should be no deletion of valid views and the fact that some artists have been cheated out of over 60 million views in hours and how people are lied to about it being about the validity of the views is absolutely disgusting. there should be no discrimination against any creators that share positive messages. there should be utter transparency in terms of view counts because depriving artists and the public of hard earned work is wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selling out. YouTube is an embarrassment of our country. They take away our freedoms yet they have made billions from our citizens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. It is beyond troubling that you are not a level playing field when it comes to demonetizing content. When, not if but when, YouTube has a fairer more equitable competitor I will leave your platform forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gotta like YouTube but a few changes are necessary. YouTubes great, everyone watches YouTube. The problem is YouTube always adds these annoying changes to improve user performance that just end up being really annoying. Theres an annoying section about COVID I swear to god Ive pressed do not show on like 20 times and every time I pop up I still have to see Dr. Fauci interviewed by someone on their podcast, if I wanted to hear about coronavirus Id use the nifty thing called a search bar and type it in. Its all for more information on COVID-19 go to cdc.gov like people have never heard of the cdc. More generally, the community posts make me want to rip my eyes out. There are some content creators I like that just absolutely spam the life out of polls just because theyre good for the algorithm. An option to hide community posts would be a perfectly fine addition and would take 5 minutes to implement. The next newest annoying YouTube feature is shorts or whatever they call them, theyre tiktok clones. There should 100% be an option to hide those too, they seriously are just spam content people make in 5 seconds hoping one of them blows up, its just tiktok and if I wanted to see tiktok videos Id go to tiktok. From a content creator side, the copyright strikes, getting videos flagged, etc. is all extremely broken. YouTubes policy on those things seems like give the person a strike first, wait for them to file an appeal, and only then does someone watch the video to see if its fair use. You can flag a video for copyright infringement for no reason at all, and most likely they will get a strike and it wont go away unless they go through the very tedious process of communicating with YouTubes team about it. Fair use doesnt seem to exist on YouTube. So it has a lot of annoying features to rant about but its YouTube and I use it all the time, but Id love to see more user customization with the feed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube censors so much content its crazy. YouTube used to be a free place, now the information gets taken down left and right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"steal views. When BTS has a lot of views YouTube decided to steal some of them. YouTube still like 100M of views just because they want. That is not fear because you give publicly to others artist, but you dont give publicly to BTS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. The censorship is so disappointing I always held YouTube and Google in high regard but now its not right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship its finest. If you like censorship and Covid 19 ads (as if you are not aware by now), then the app is for you Somehow, YouTube assumes that all users are idiots and cannot think for themselves, therefore, they feel the need to limit what you can see and push their agendas on the public. Would be so much nicer if this app could be objective and allow the consumer to make their own choices. If I could give less than 1 star, I would.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube is on the wrong side of history, and making people feel frustrated and suffocated. Theres so much I have to run all over the place to find, so although youre making it more difficult, youre not stopping people from getting to the information they have a right to know, youre just losing views, respect and loyalty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just because youre popular, doesnt mean you can ignore your customers. This app, and website, is eventually going to go the way of digg. Its the same story, more and more changes that the community hates, and flatly ignoring feedback. Theres no tech company immune to failure, and at this point Im waiting for it to hit YouTube. Whats wrong?Well the issues with the website are well known, censorship and adpocalypse and all that, theyve basically ruined their gaming section while pretending they can compete with twitch. Im sorry, demonetizing mortal kombat because you can see digital blood wont make you compete with twitch. But the app?I have metered internet. I put music videos on while Im studying, on low resolutions because its freaking music. And twice today alone Ive had to check it because it decided I was wrong, and actually wanted 1080p/60fps music videos. Screw my actual input, google knows better. I wonder how many millions of gigs google eats this way, its probably worth a class action lawsuit. YouTube is one of the only apps for streaming that literally ignores your settings. And doesnt have a built in setting to change bit rate for all videos. Also, Im not freaking paying for YouTube premium. I would, to support creators I like, but see my previous point about demonetization. No, showing me literally 3 HOUR ADS wont change my mind. Neither will pausing my music to ask if Im still here, that just made me subscribe to tidal for work. I cant exactly touch my phone while Im up to my elbows in raw chicken. And why the hell have thumbs down buttons for ads if they literally do nothing? I *hate* gambling. I have thumbed down or said dont show me online betting about 30-40 times. Literally no change. I even thumbs up on stuff I like, filled in ad preferences, there is no reason for YouTube to be forcing addictions on me every 3 minutes.I miss the old YouTube. The one where people could upload what they wanted and the community decided what would be popular. Where there werent 8-10 ads for a 10 minute video. And definitely where google didnt act like it knew what you wanted more than you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ads and Censorship. Im tired of making google money and they dare to censor the influencers Im interested in watching,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So MUCH CENSORSHIP. I can no longer find the content I want. YouTube and google are now political organizations that destroy our first amendment rights, censor our speech, and stop at nothing so they can interfere with our US elections and the foundations of our democracy. They are now deleting comments if you disagree with them politically. Google/YouTube is absolutely sick. We need a replacement stat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring people. YouTube will not allow you to be your true self. YouTube plays politics. YouTube is racist YouTube is secretly undermining the constitution. YouTube is like bleach, it works for whites but destroys color",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smh. Its so hard to even want to watch YouTube anymore because of the ads. Yall literally started adding 1 hour long ads for short videos and its insane. And I usually dont have a problem with ads because they allow my favorite content creators to make money but we all know Youtube is just purposely adding ads in everybodys videos even if they didnt ask for it. Its really weird and annoying. Also a lot of good content creators are having their accounts randomly banned. Like its not even funny because I keep losing so many videos from my private playlist because the channels they belong to keep getting deleted randomly and its really not fair. I was already getting tired of Youtube ever since yall tried to join the copy TikTok trend and its really annoying. I dont care for these YouTube reels and stories. Also YouTube has been around for so long now that you would think that yall would have a decent blocking system. Spam comments are so outrageous and if youre getting harassed by weird users under a comment you can only block their comments on your channel. I dont know why we cant effectively block unwanted comments under other peoples comment sections but yall should add it as a feature instead of adding unnecessary and irrelevant things. Also yall keep randomly deleting channels but actual problematic channels me and other people report doesnt even get a warning or taken down whatsoever. Like yall want your platform to be safe but let terrible creators thrive on there- My other socials are all becoming Tiktok copies and its upsetting Youtube is doing the same thing when it should just be a place to watch videos. Every update makes the layout look ugly in some way. And if you do update and its something good yall change it immediately without asking user opinion. All in all this is so played out on yalls part and Im very tired of trying to watch videos and then getting thrown the most weird and long obscure ads that have nothing to do with the content I consume. Yall major platforms are gonna regret doing all of this extra because somebodys going to make an app to upstage yall someday smh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offer us anonymity for cash while infotheft, packaging and mashing still isnt a crime.Ive got no misdeeds, crimes or bad habits to hide, I just dont want another million spam calls if I get interested in looking up a subject.I dont want political ads targeted and manipulated based on videos I choose to watch.

YouTube/Google are not public platforms. Massive Censorship... I use Dlive and Parler apps ... No censorship on these apps .. YouTube likes to hide the truth from its users .. These Far-Leftist freaks are extremely bias  This is another company that needs to be sued into oblivion.. Make this a Public Utility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Downhill. Data privacy very sus and the censorship is apparent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube... MyTube.... I appreciate the content I come across. I like how I can make my own playlists. I also like how I can comment on a video and have others give their opinions. Though were not conscious of it all the time we do it we are practicing our freedom of speech and sharing thoughts and ideas that are priceless (if they help someone). I would like to add that censoring people may be necessary but I hope Youtube does it with discretion. People dont like to be railroaded yet there is a need for limits. Id like to think YouTube is not practicing double-standards. Continue to allow users the freedom to show their truths and connect worldwide. And kudos for helping add creativity to an already creative world. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whats worse than apps selling your personal information?. YouTube videos made for kids that you cannot watch with mini player. Seriously, how on earth does that protect kids??? And dont say because then kids will continue to keep scrolling through other videos. Worst of all, you cant even comment on the video to tell the maker that you cant watch it on multiplayer so its just a pain in the SENSORED, as we wouldnt want to scar the kids reading these reviews for life. Terrible. YouTube please change this or at least disable the kids protection on accounts that do not have kids watching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corporate preferential treatment. Stop suppressing independent content creators that built YouTube and promoting corporations. Super annoying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring...I love YouTube but would like easier controls and NO CENSORSHIP. YouTube is the greatest thing ever but....When watching a video, it would be nice if there were a backup button you could press and a drop down would appear offering easy click choices of say back up 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, or a programmable amount.  Current controls are maddening especially on tablets or phones.  Also ads should never cover the content while a video is playing. And CENSORSHIP IS UNAMERICAN AND SHOULD NOT BE USED HERE.  BECAUSE OF ABUSE OF POWER AND CENSORSHIP, THIS PLATFORM WILL BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU CENSORS.  HUMANITY DOES NOT CONSENT TO YOUR CONTROL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring. YouTube used to be great and filled with interesting content. Now theyve gotten so strangely controlling about what content you can and cant see. Im tired of you pushing your ideology on me through content YouTube, just be a platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Stop censoring and defunding YouTubers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring. If you continue to censor, you will alienate users who will jump ship the moment a competitor steps up. I used to give YouTube 5 stars, then 4, and now 3. I am a big boy and can decipher what is hateful and what is not. I dont need a San Francisco lefty deciding for me. The Media has gotten so biased and pathetic I decided to turn to YouTube so I can hear various opinions and a variety of views. That is what makes YouTube a valued source. If you continue to try to put your finger on the scale you will lose every day rational Americans who actually love this nation and you will be stuck with only those that hate America and YouTube will become toxic just like Twitter has become. I just signed up for Parler yesterday. Larger Companies than Google have collapsed because in their arrogance, they left themselves wide open to competitors who offered a more honest and uncorrupted service or product. Not to mention the Government using anti trust to break you up. But dont take my word for it. Half of America is conservative (and growing) and will dash in the blink of an eye to an objective platform once given the chance with competition. Take your finger off the scale and let America speak freely  Hatred will be policed and exposed by the viewers without you guys subjectively identifying it. Not liking BLM is not hatred. It just means their methods and tactics are not unifying or palatable for some. Its not rocket science. I hope to see some drastic improvement soon or I will be looking for an alternative way to be entertained and/or get my information. Im already starting to use duck duck go as my web browser and its getting better. Dont become biasedGood night",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash Ads. The forced ads are trash. No one wants to see them. Thats why google is forcing them on users of Youtube. Advertisers are foolish to think paying to be noticed will work for sales. It only pisses people off and turns them off the brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ads. I hate that you want people to pay for ad free YouTube, and to push it on your users, you put so many ads in the videos that in the span of 9 minutes, Ill have skipped through 4 ads. Then, as if that isnt bad enough, the you tubers have been so deprived of monetization because of your guidelines, even their videos have ads in it How do you not see a problem with this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship is fascism. Stop censoring people just because they dont have the same ideology as you. YouTube used to be a great app/website to find information on a wide range of topics. Now you just censor and remove content that goes against your beliefs. If your ideology and beliefs are so perfect then they should hold up against any scrutiny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My experience as a YouTube user. In the beginning of my membership I loved YouTube  Then you began to censor the people I listen to  Not because they lie, but because they say things you don&#39;t want to hear  Things you disagree with  The truth  I keep YouTube to be able to keep up with the truth  Not propaganda  I truly hope you will stop censoring people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Advertisement Monster. Full of Advertisements an no way to block them without giving them access to youre wallet. Best sticking with browser based youtube as just the same but you can keep the money hungry monsters at bay.. I tend to say away from content creators that plastered there videos with ads but now it more like 5 ads per a video. Hope google is fixing all the problems in the world with all that money.. we need more video platforms that not are just about invading peoples wallets..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Review. I personally like YouTube for the access to information. We have come so far, when we can type in specific things and get the results we are looking for. With out YouTube I feel like the internet, cable, tv networks would have us think what they wanted for us instead of thinking for ourselves. Thanks YouTube Access to information is freedom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infringing on our Rights. Theres no reason why YouTube is censoring our media.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Finest of Corporate Evil. YouTube arbitrarily censors content that they dont like, they only promote things that fit their world view.They are slowly turning into Fox News.You can say things that promote America late stage capitalism all you want, any criticism of it, your account gets throttled, they delete your subscribers, throttle your views, demonetize your videos.Delete this app, dont let his corporate evil pollute your phone. Boycott YouTube for their selective censorship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dictator type company. Due to YouTubes constant control of what people can and cant say or do on YouTube Im deleting and quitting watching any videos on their site. They are blocking content if people have a different opinion then them or their employees which isnt right people have a right to free speech if someone dont like it they can quit watching said content but to out right control everything is ridiculous as far as Im concerned they and anyone that work for them need to get some thicker skin and quit being so sensitive. And for you people that support this enjoy having your rights taken away cause this type of stuff is just the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. If you like your comments  censored then this is the platform for you. Google can try to hide facts but people already know. Google is a monopoly and should be broken up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. If YouTube could work less on enforcing tyranny in the land of free the world would be a better place. information and communications should have a free platform anyone opposed to such is automatically guilty of treason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop Censoring. Love YouTube but I HATE how they have throttled and censored some channels for posting content that goes against the mainstream narrative. I value free speech and diversity of ideas, YouTube is supposed to be a place where those ideals are valued and protected as well. Not so much anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. The app is great and I use it constantly without technical issue.   The problem I have is that YouTube determines (censorship) what can be uploaded and demonetizes content creators because they don't align with YouTubes views.  Obviously illegal activities should not be uploaded but outside of that the users of YouTube should be left to decide, based on likes, etc what is reasonable content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ads, cant dislike, and poor algorithms. I can no longer enjoy the app the way I could in the past. Longer, more prolific ads, algorithms that slowly close you into a repeating cast of the same videos, and worse, now we cant even see dislike counts to judge the merit of a video, particularly informational videos. Youd think with the problem of disinformation spread on this site, YouTube would want to facilitate users policing creators by voicing their opinion. Google makes money hand over fist, and pushes to see just how much they can squeeze out of users, as seen in the highly corporate, advertiser friendly environment we now find ourselves as users of YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Allowing our corporate overlords into your home. Great way to sell your personal interests, political leanings, hobbies, and music choices to the google corporation- for free.  As this information is then sold to advertisers google can continue to buy our politicians, influence our laws, expand its monopoly, and cram down their corporate opinions on any user- for free.  Also if you decide to become a YouTuber for profit you can look forward to being censored, shadow banned, harassed, and eventually removed if you violate the rules that are sometimes hidden or altered without warning. Which means you will be working for YouTube to build their platform and increase the user base- for free.  Not to worry though, YouTube is not a publisher of content, it is only a platform so they arent legally responsible for any of the content on their website. Even if they act like one all the time.  So yeah go ahead and get the app its- for free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A video streaming platform of over censorship, copyright claim abuse, and advertising spam. Ive used YouTube since 2015 and the direction the platform has taken towards in recent years has just made it a complete dumpster fire. YouTube has gotten overly restrictive on censorship where your account can just get banned or suspended over the most minor rule violations. Im on my fourth YouTube account now after my last three were banned permanently for criticism against a news article that was fake. I didnt even say anything that would violate their rules, they just straight up kicked me off with no reason.Not only that, but I constantly get spammed with ads on videos Im watching. A recent five minute video I watched had over fifteen ad interruptions (because there two ads per ad interruption on YouTube) and it wouldnt let me skip them at all. Its bad enough when I have to deal with one or two ads but fifteen is just outrageous. I should be able to watch the videos I want in peace, not be berated with ads after a long day of work.What also is frustrating is how many of my favorite you-tubers get copy strikes over nothing while having their video removed. Ive seen so many of my favorite you-tubers get kicked from the platform to where theres no point in using it anymore. They dont even get to appeal to have the decision reversed or get looked into why they were banned in the first place, it just them getting booted off and not being able to return now.In the end, YouTube is a video streaming platform that has gone downhill is recent years and is just destroying the platform, kicking users off for no reason, all while bombarding users with repetitive ads and overly censoring them. Dont download the app or get YouTube unless you want to date the nightmare this platform has become.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring. If you would stop demonetizing people, and let us see and educate what we want on our own you would have sky rocket ratings     We the people beg of you to stop this I love love YouTube, but to not letting us see certain news is WRONG      Just like making sure you put under every video...  AP selects Joe Biden as president elect???? Last time I checked the Alternative Press DOES NOT PICK THE PRESIDENT       We the people do Stop picking what we can see As well, I do not get half my notifications anymore from my subscribed channels.      Whats WORSE IS I PAY FOR PREMIUM??? What premium oppression and censorship? Fix it YouTube you owe the people that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing videos but see my review. Look the whole concept of this platform is stunning. I learn things and see things on here I would never have easy access to in the past 10/10 for that. You need to accept that adverts help everyone earn money . I can only imagine the huge cost to you tube just for their storage of this online content. Plus folk earn money for advertising , I get that and accept it. Glad adds can be switched off after a few seconds. Feedback The only negative feedback I have is this..1. Please let people download clips onto their phones and other devices for free.It helps if we are out of Internet access places. Also sometimes its good to have a clip you like just to keep watching whenever you like and not having to rely on any Internet connection that would be super helpful for me personally and my family. For example the kids travelling in the car the Internet drops and we like to let them see some of the clips online on their own devices they keep asking me while Im driving to help and I cant. I know you say we can pay for thisBut to be honest I cant afford it for my whole family and I think the price you charge is far too high and makes you look greedy guys it really does. If you charged $4 a month thing okay we can afford that gets rid of the adverts and really works well but Im in the UK and its more like 20 odd dollars a month which is ridiculous you make money from the advertising stop being greedy. I think the biggest mistake youve made is that that is out of price for teenagers who are likely to watch a lot of your your content. If my 16-year-old asked me to pay your monthly charge I would say no if it was a lot cheaper I would say yes and you have millions of young teenagers paying in there for cheaper price more people say money but more people watching and connecting its not rocket science guys.2.Okay Ive giving you five stars but my main gripe is when you do pay up and I did pay up for one month to see how it works is you are not allowed to save the clips in your video section on your own devices it actually downloads in the YouTube app and after one month is deleted. Why are why do you do that what a waste of everyones time and resources allow people to download the clip onto their own device stop trying to control everything you will find the more you give away the more people will buy it I know you need to make money but this makes you look a little bit greedy once again who ever has advise you to do thatHas misadvised you and made you look greedy stop doing it we live in a world where people give away free papers for the advertisers to reach people who might not buy papers. Yes you give away free clips let people download them when I show a clip to someone else they say where did you get it I could say this is on YouTube they would go and look for it that you go free advertising. Anyway complaint overBeen wanting to get that off my chest for a long time now feel better already but youre still far too expensive sorry guys a monthly fee should be really cheap you want millions to do it not just those that can afford this. Especially in this season when millions of being unemployed due to COVID-19 do the world a favour and give everyone a chance to sign up to dollars a month you have the world on board boardI should work for you guys Ill make you more money , your going about it the wrong way go well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube, not so carefree anymore or as fun. Google, you have systematically and greedily killed projects, taken back what was once free to use, and now bully people watching videos on YouTube. Ive always been a strong supporter of this company until recently because I couldnt quite grasp why people have turned against a search engine business, but now I get it. Do no evil isnt real. Now YouTube isnt a fun place to go. We used to have good times watching videos and sharing information but now its a nightmare of rules & regulation, or bots with algorithms stopping the enjoyment and experience we once had. If we dont pay you we get ad after ad after ad after ad and not only this, many are not simple ads, they are infomercials The worst scourge on humanity ever. Keep it up and you wont have a friend left in the world Google, seriously. Ive lost all respect for this company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My channel. I have been using YouTube for quite a few years since it began. I am having a problem the way the people are being treated through being demonized I have sent money to many of the guys who are whistle blowers. The information these people give is great. It is good to know that YouTube is unable to control them. If youtube were to continue to harass them and they leave YouTube I will definitely leave with them. YouTube needs to not allow the corporate media to continue to control who they allow to broadcast. I am well aware that GOOGLE is the entity that owns YouTube. GOOGLE also is part of the Satanic cult that is trying to destroy America. So GOOGLE is helping in that endeavor. GOOGLE must stop or find itself non existent cause the American people are done with your crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube is great but needs to change policy. They are censoring whats right and spreading the bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google suppression. What else do you demonetize, Google?  Suppressing voters, maybe?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Suppression of information. While I enjoy YouTube for many things, I rate them low to their suppression of information. The strategic disregard for any opposing political or medical views are biased and repeated over and over again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ads. I realise YouTube need to put ads on their app but the sheer amount of them is annoying and is affecting my viewing experience. The constant bombardment of ads all because these companies have a sole aim to extract money from our pockets is not sitting well with me at all. Why should l then have to pay YouTube for the privilege of NOT seeing them? You are all full of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censoring everything And theres too many ads. Stop censoring stuff.  We can decide for ourselves if something is fake news.And I hate all of the ads Why wont youtube limit them? It feels like you are allowing so many ads to force users into purchasing the version without ads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad service and censorship. YouTube has become nothing more than an ad revenue service and stands against everything the first amendment stands for. (Yes Im aware that its a private business and they can establish their own policies) the only reason why YouTube thrives is because they lack a major competitor and can continue to demonotize every video they want to and only show ads that represent one side of very heated debate and discussion. It doesnt matter what your opinion is about political, social or environmental issue are. YouTube advertisements isnt the place to indoctrinate audiences who are just trying to enjoy their favorite content creators content. The moment YouTube is presented with a major competitor that establishes a free speech and non-censored content environment. Im leaving this app forever. P.S. For YouTube, I sincerely hope theres a special day reserved for you in the court of law where you physically violate the constitution of the United States and fall with all the media net works who actively censor and create propaganda for the masses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censors ruin freedom. I no longer trust YouTube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop standing on the way of the truth. YouTube most or should but be a place where people hear the truth that will destroy or confirm their foundation. You cannot play the role of providing a platform and censorship at the same time. Some criminals have been being exposed, but you chose to block the videos that expose them. This makes you a criminal too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google Should be Ashamed. Theyre greedy for pushing the paid version of YouTube after already making tons of money off of ad revenue. Stop being horrible humans, you make enough money. Please pay taxes also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensorship. YouTube has a basic monopoly on their platform and the censor people and push political agendas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youtube is awful and some day more people will realize. that youtube started out decent but like most things in culture today, all that matters is eyeballs and nothing else. the relentless catering to the viewer can always be justified as good cuz it makes things easier and better for u, but in the long run its only to keep u coming back to youtube over and over and over again. so much so that ur psychologicallly addicted to watching things while exposing urself to ads. dont like ads? no problem. pay your way around them. its not muchjust a little bit of money every month forever or until u remember to cancel. also in this rant id like to mention that without any notice, youtube deleted all of my videos from my account. and theres nobody to talk to or help me get them back. sure, i have them saved elsewhere, but the fact that nobody can help me get them back to my youtube account really is incredible. youtube is massive and makes a lot of money yet cant offer any actual human to help me with their service. why is that? in conclusion, i have significantly decreased my watching of youtube cuz its really quite stupid and an unhealthy trap to get u addicted. there are more posers and wannabes than i could ever imagine on youtube these days and i want nothing to do with those folks. sure, there are some good things out of youtube, like learning and helping people, but the overall design of the youtube service is absolutely wretched and twisted due to ads and playing on the human psyche for exploitation. not to mention censorship and arbitrary monitoring of information, which i didnt even get intoeff youtube for what it has become. im glad i didnt fall victim to this service. i almost did but saw the light. eff you youtube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Treating content creators like dirt. 1) You take advertising revenue away from the best channels. 2) You still show ads on demonitized videos, effectively stealing from the content creators. 3) Automated copyright algorithms take down videos that fall under fair use and theres no real people at youtube to talk to about this. 4) Constantly advertising your subscription service. I dont support platforms that fail to pay and bully their content creators. Google/YouTube are getting far too greedy. It is not a complaint about content makers at all.Update: Im getting really annoyed with seeing gambling adverts every five minutes. This is predatory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A huge spying joke. This app is a joke. So many ads, (usually 1-2 before a video) and bad recommendation systems. But the real issue here is your RIDICULOUS marketing practices. I mean I looked at what data you collect from people, and boy, it wasnt pretty.So if Im right, you collect people names,phone numbers, emails, purchase history, and even your LOCATION. I know you need to target ads for marketing but holy cow thats a lot of data just for one app. I mean its like your spying to see what were doing on the internet and our browsing history. That just scares me. Your darn customers need to realize their getting too close for comfort. PROBLEM 1: advertising revenue There are way too many ads with YouTube. Stop. Please. I mean 30 seconds in your video-AD 2 more seconds-ADVERTISEMENT Oh yeah and IT DOES NOT STOP FROM THERE. This is a mountain of greed and the want for money. And they dont fix any bugs or glitches.

Control your internet pay for premium.

Citizen. The free flow of information is vital for a robust society. YouTube is an enemy of the people. Shame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much data collecting and censorship. Somehow, YouTube knows everything about you and the commercials to you make you feel that you have no privacy at all. Try looking up some conservative news, biblical, or American history, YouTube only shows bias videos to what you are looking up. In fairness, you can find what you are looking for but its way harder than finding liberal news, anti Christian, and anti American videos. Bias",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sick of Corrupt YouTube Censorship. Its none of YouTubes business to decide what I believe is credible vs misinformation. I am an educated human being who is expected to be intelligent enough to work, pay my bills, house & feed my family, and as such I expect to have the freedom to watch whatever I desire and be allowed to decide for myself whether some or all of it is true or not. This censorship on social media is actually what has made me change my mind about who I will vote for this year, as I will vote for those who will protect my freedom to do just that as well as all of my God given freedoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube needs thick skin and less ads. Bring the old YouTube back You cant even see the dislikes anymore. YouTube censors everything because kids might be watching isnt that why you made YouTube kids? Whats the point of making that useless app if youre trying to censor everything? Now everyone gets offended over little things and we constantly have to watch what we say, walking on eggshells, for speaking our minds. We have the freedom of speech yet we cant use it anymore. Stupid app is getting worse. These updates arent updates. Youre evolving but backwards. I cant enjoy a video without being bombarded by 2 ads back to back every 5 minutes. Its annoying Before youd be able to avoid them and now you cant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom should still exist. Ive been finding more and more lately that YouTube is censoring the important videos that Im interested in seeing.

"Censorship. I think that is absolutely asinine that YouTube allows certain channels to flourish and achieve great heights and it cuts the legs out from under channels that do not go along with the so-called social narrative. Channels that want to talk about thinks like guns or certain situations involving guns continue to be censored. If you are a republican and you do not agree with leftist views or democrat views then you are censored. We are not even talking about the President Trump supporters, just a republicanThe hypocrisy of YouTube is astounding. YouTube and Google are disgrace to the American people or should I say some of them. YouTube like most social media giants at this time only want your voice to be heard if it aligns with their view points. YOUR A JOKE YOUTUBE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship Is A Problem. Freedom of speech doesnt mean silencing, demonetizing, and censoring anyone who has opinions and beliefs different from your own. YouTube is actively stopping creators from earning ad revenue simply because they dont agree with their point of view. Thats the way I see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube censors free speech. Keeps censoring real news. They follow a globalist agenda and try to deny us the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have silence intelligent honestlaw abiding individuals that pose no harm or threat to anyone.Anyone other than You... at YouTube who choose to try to silence just because you do nt like what someone has to say.Its not hate speech were talking about here its truth.Its a Colossal mistake and is so wide of the mark its so obvious what you at YouTube are trying to do. Its comedy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Too often YouTube censors Conservative Content or demonetizes conservative youtubers. As a platform you should only censor people that show violence in their videos. When you censor people just because of their political views it tells me that YouTube is an enemy of the 1st Amendment which is Truly UnAmerican. You can disagree with people but everyones voice should be heard If the Censorship continues I guarantee that conservatives will eventually leave and create their own platform and cause YouTube to lose a lot of money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Intentionally censors information pertaining to quality of user submitted content. The intentional censorship of the number of s results in a staggering inability to confirm the validity and quality of a videos contents, even upon watching it. Video creators can also selectively delete comments on their videos, meaning dissenting viewpoints/agenda/debunkings can be completely silenced on a video/channel/affiliation. The algorithm of suggested videos favors misinformation and aggression, even on a fresh account, producing a whirlpool echo chamber of misinformation and hate. These are the traits that make people stay on social media (or adjacent) sites and consequently provide the ads on the sites more eyeballs. YouTube puts their own profit and agendum over user experience and actively chooses to further propagate misinformation and hate speech on their site and into society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube. Advantages:- Free with internet.- Puts you in control of your own viewing in terms of timing, diversity of familiar mainstream broadcast as well as original content and quality of uploads.- Allows comment on content.- An undeniable public good.Disadvantages:Let me think... ? Nothing comes to mind immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship isnt good. Im giving one star because YouTube among other social media apps are censoring free speech. If they are a platform then be a platform and dont remove anything. Let people decide for themselves. How will people think for themselves when you cant hear both sides of a subject. Doesnt matter what subject. Censoring what you dont want people to hear is wrong. If you are going to edit people and their content, then you are a publisher. You abide by the rules that apply, but YouTube is having it both ways, acting like a publisher while claiming to be a platform. Pick one, you cant be both. Be the platform you claim and let open discussion thrive. If social media is censoring it, its more than likely true. Covid, vaccines, China Joe, Trump. You are likely hearing propaganda only when censorship takes hold. Its dangerous and its here at our doors. Dont let them win or freedom will be a thing of the past, telling future generations about back when we had freedoms in a low whisper so you dont get caught talking about a subject thats no longer allowed. Think it cant happen.. Im watching it happen now. Scared yet? You should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing censorship glad I have them to guide me. As a 38 year old adult I am glad that YouTube is here to censor things for me because I a to dumb to do it for myself.  Big brother does an amazing job of keeping me safe I am excited to see more of what they can do to keep me safe from quote on quote misinformation.  Its almost like living at home again where mommy and daddy can help keep me safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something for everyone. YouTube continues to big bigger and better information in wider categories. If monitored by adults there is something for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your new policies. I really dont appreciate how youre censoring people on YouTube anymore I dont think its a good path for the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mostly good. YouTube is definitely convenient, but their censoring of legitimate content is obvious. Shadow-banning and censoring content is bad practice, and by doing so YouTube is discreetly being an arbiter of truth. Thats not freedom, thats propaganda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What privacy?. Take serious for once the terms of service of YouTube. These guys have NSA status over you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Longtime User. Altogether Ive been using Youtube for over a decade. It used to be a great place where I learned a lot about things that I couldnt find elsewhere. Like the supernatural, or hidden history, theories and debates regarding faith and religion, information on politics that the cable networks would never show, little-known music and content creators of all kinds, and countless other things. But ever since about 2016, all my favorite channels have been removed. My favorite videos censored or hidden. The algorithm makes the video recommendations so narrow and predictable, based on click-rates. Its hard to discover new things, and even the search results are so heavily biased towards big content creators and mainstream sources. Comments are automatically censored for silly things that often make no sense. There doesnt seem to be a balance anymore and its a shame.  Youtube just seems to get worse. Censorship is not a truth-loving action. Its insulting to say through the companies actions that you think people are too stupid to know what is right or wrong, truth or nonsense when viewing content. That they cant decide on their own. And if you cut out a persons tongue, arent you not proving them wrong but only that youre afraid of what they might say? As the quote goes. I hope Youtube goes back to freedom not more restriction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of censorship. YouTube has now become and activist social media platform. Severely limiting free speech and picking the big media over small youtubers.  I would recommend other social media apps YouTube is destined for a slow painful app death,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship?. My husband and I have always enjoyed YouTube videos. As Americans, living overseas, its a home comfort to be able to continue watching our favorite shows. When you created the subscription options of YouTube Red and YouTube TV, we dismissed it as a company needing to earn revenue. But, your latest decision to CENSOR all videos which express any ideas about election fraud is a step too far. Those companies have the right to FREEDOM OF SPEECH, as well as to CONDUCT their businesses. Many of those same companies rely on the monetized revenue they earn from YouTube views. When certain other groups made videos claiming evidence for reasons of impeachment for the sitting President of the United States, you didnt CENSOR them. So, Im confused as to why you feel its okay to do so NOW? Last time I checked, its STILL the United States of America...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I wish YouTube/ google would not censor some  people yet not others. This is illegal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube. Stop censoring people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom. Stop censoring we the people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Google. Stop censoring people for having different opinions than Google.  The bigger you are the harder you fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cj. Stop censoring. YouTubes agenda is obvious to nearly everyone. If YouTube doesnt change course it will destroy itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring and demonitizing. YouTube censors and demonetizes content that it doesnt agree with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quit censoring. Its disappointing to see that YouTube censors material that doesnt fit their agenda. Its unfortunate and not a platform that is making a positive name for itself. YouTube support pedophiles and human trafficking, and a lot of hate and racism. But when the truth comes out in droves, your platform censors and manipulated. Your company supports child molestation and that is despicable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having a Security Password to connect to TV. I use Youtube often especially on my TV, I use my phone to connect to my TV. I love having the ability to do it seamlessly but theres one thing I also hate about it, its that anyone  can connect to it and its really annoying since I have a sibling that just can connect to it when ever they want. Youtube can use a security system where if you punch in your password once and itll connect to your TV, so the other person cant connect to it since a password is required. This will definitely help a lot. Thank You.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hateful YouTube channels. There are millions of hateful propaganda machines in the YouTube platform Please keep the world safe. The world is unsafe because of YouTube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube Allows Crypto Scam Ads. YouTube allows crypto scam ads on their website, so I guess they dont care about their users anymore. Speaking of ads, its getting so ridiculous its unbearable to be on YouTube these days unless you want to be spammed with multiple ads every 30 seconds. Shame on you, YouTube, you sold out on your dedicated users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too much censorship. They promote making propaganda and then they block people telling the truth, I make playlists and my playlists are full of holes because all of the people get blocked or kicked off of YouTube that are speaking truth to power. I love the content creators, but their overlords are full of power and are corrupted by it.YouTube/google, Is a terrible organization that funded our current epidemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like it but it needs some TLC. Hi YouTube, YouTubers and those who are new,Yes definitely who can disagree that YouTube it has done something innovative that we all definitely rely on a lot and it has a lot of great channels. I can go on and on how lots of the channels have helped me in. More ways that I can say. As I am sure it has to others.However, that being said I do not like the blocker user and channel or content options or ways of doing things its like they put the person making the channel above the users.  The parental controls both on YouTube and kids YouTube are horrendous.  I lost count how many times Ive blocked or complained about the content that the children see if you block anything anything with similar content needs to be blocked permanently until we change what we allow to be seen.  And in every language our culture and beliefs should be respected and it is not taken into account at all by YouTube so it seems.  They need to hire a team designated just for that Working round the clock categorizing channels. My older and younger sons are being influenced because of your neglect.  I wish I could sit with both and monitor everything but I am a mom I have to cook, clean, organize, laundry, dishes, sweeping, dusting, so on so fourth and have my own computer things I need to do like check emails I reference to my eldest school stuff.  Other personal things to so I cant stress enough better to not download it for the kids and download other ones like Kidoodle.TV...Also, it needs to be brought to the 2021 century... how do I mean like Disney, Hulu Netflix, etc. and most videos allow give us the ability to keep Watch or listening on our phones and multitask and do another things...an example is that when I am watching some videos its music and I rather listen to my Spotify while watching the video so I need YouTube to have the capability to allow multitasking...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of the press. While youtube is exposing innocent children to violent gaming contents and sexually explicit materials, they are restricting legit media outlets that exposes violent oppression of innocent women and children instigated and sponsernd by powerful nations appeasing their political power..Shameful double standard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Google is a criminal, but. Finally I don&#39;t hate YouTube. I can eliminate all the stupid covid hysteria and garbage I hate from showing up in my face on my phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship TM,. I don&#39;t really care, YouTube has a right to deny service, but the one star review is because of multiple things1 - FormattingThe formatting style changes so rapidly, it&#39;s hard to get used to. I like the new comments section thing, but the old format of YouTube was ovjectively better and easier to use.2 - Data TrackingEven when i&#39;m signed out, or on incognito, even when i have search history and clear on pause, and unchecked all my google account tracking boxes, even when using a vpn, I still get the same annoying ads which I know are targetted to me. Based on videos I&#39;ve watched, yt never forgets.3. Censorship of Channels Youtube&#39;s employees disagree withThere are a myriad of conservative &amp; other right-leaning channels that Youtube demonitizes and takes down for no reason. An example: Louder with Crowder. It&#39;s a conservative show where the host delivers news information, commentary, and occasionally hosts change my minds. youtube has demonitized him and shut down his youtube account simply for his political views. im not sugarcoating this in any way, check for yourself.Youtube has eh formatting, constantly tracks your data, and censors content creators it disagrees with who havent violated anything, only proves the creators points tbh lol.That is why I&#39;m giving this app a one-star review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom to the people. Please keep truth dont mess with clarity of peoples evidence that s one thing I will say people have the right to truth all the people causing shut down s to truths need to be addressed with the truth otherwise spot on . Make sure that the esoteric truths keep coming because they have changed my life for the better big up to you tube for not getting rid of those videos because I think the creator might have something to say about that ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lazily sitting on top. Oh sorry, did I hurt Googles feelings? You know a lot of users watch YouTube from their smart TVs. You sit there fine tuning the ad algorithms but dont update the app for that user?Why doesnt the YouTube app know what Im watching on in tv and present me the video information? That way I could leave a like, comment, subscriber or whatever easily. More engagement is what you want right?Stop worrying about enticing people to buy  another app and start fixing things for the smart tv users. You want YouTube to take over right? Actually try to improve the product then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. No more censorship by commie google employees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Google and YouTube are anti free speech. Unfortunately they limit availability of content and videos which makes them the enemy of the people as points of view have a harder time reaching the masses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Commercials And censorship. When YouTube started you prided yourselves on the commercial free environment.  Im inundated with them now, and I dont appreciate it.Your political agenda is obvious, and Im tired of content being censored, banned, and demonetized for not confirming to your ideals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anti Free Speech. YouTube employees ought to be ashamed of themselves for YouTubes egregious partisan censorship. You stand against freedom and censor objective reality to curb dissent, all in order to manipulate and control people into wasting their money, time and ultimately their lives on idiotic policies that are against their interest and freedoms. Not to mention the blatant abuse of market dominance. I consider YouTube to be in the pool of people who fought to keep slavery in the US and cant wait for you to be sued to oblivion and split up or replaced with a better competitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased and full of creeps. The people who run YouTube are so politically biased that its sickening. You get bombarded by advertisements only from one side of the political spectrum and no matter how many times you click not interested they keep coming back. They sensor people who they dont agree with, shamelessly give absolute creeps and child predators a platform, and they are just overall an awful, shady business. I cant wait until something replaces this site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube safety. The comments and some content can be bad and either way if you cant get on it or can it shouldnt be there I highly recommend deleting that content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Tired of YouTubes content warnings and censorship.   YouTube has no monopoly on truth.   How about we let the people judge for themselves what is truth and what isnt.  You havent been doing a very good job of it.  A free market of ideas?  Or a technological dictatorship ruled by censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FREEDOM. YouTube gives a voice to the voiceless, gives everyone a platform if they choose to use it, to leave their legacy, and forever be remembered in videos. Forever immortalized in their passions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember when YouTube was bias free?. Sick and tired of being fed  Googles agenda and seeing them censor content creators. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Controlling views. YouTube wants everyone to abide by the four corners of their contracts but takes every occasion to be dishonest , this controlled network will never suit my life because thats just it.. its controlled and setup for YouTube to profit not the creator of the video lying about the views so they can continue to profit from each video..nothing anyone can do because they controlls every portion of this wicked network. But know one day your controlling powers you have want exist.. Stay tuned a missile near you ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Limits free speech. YouTube is a money making corporation owned by google that uses its power to limit free speech and and not abide by the spirit of the constitution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whats not to like?. There is only one thing I can think of that disappoints me about youtube: censorship. Ive experienced it. Stop narrowing what people are exposed to. Stand up for diverse content. Stand up for a better world. Nurture freedom of access to ALL opinions, not just the mainstream narratives of paid media and advertisers. The rest of the content, true content, matters too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lack of Privacy. Recently YouTube have enforced a age verification process as they deem some of the videos to be not suitable for under 18 years of age, they do have YouTube kids however they wish to frustrate everyone else and steal there data on the original platform, they ask for ID cards/driving license, passports and bank details/credit cards This is to establish your age but at what risk? Do we just start handing out these forms of sensitive data to prove to a video upload service just to prove we can watch how to peel a banana on YouTube I think not This is a major privacy breach of our data and Apple dont seem to be doing anything about this despite their privacy enforcements surrounding Collection of data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App with problems and steals info( oh I mean protects). I use YouTube so I can over look some of its many flaw like its copyright system the way it handles stuff and so for but recently there has been a requirement on the AppStore to show the information that the app needs to work I mean the only reason Im still using it in general is that there no other way to watch these same videos not to mention for most of the stuff it collects theres no real justification except that they sell your information on the pretense of using it to personalize adds if you dont believe me check out literally any app owned by google and youll see the same huge list of your information it uses like for example why the heck does it need access to your contacts seriously can that be explained.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to be censored and demonetized post your videos here. Scary to think that YouTube wont allow the best president weve had in decades have a voice Youre a socialist platform. Google hates hard working American citizens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unsafe application. If you look at the Data Linked to You area, almost everything is connected, and this is owned by google which got sued for selling your information. Now, it is a good app to watch videos but not for safety of your info",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Down the Drain. YouTube has been in an extreme downward spiral for a long time, and it just continues to get worse and worse. Theres a whole treasure trove of horrible practices YouTube has that punish creators unfairly while promoting big companies and corporations who do the same thing. Monetization is a joke. You still play ads on videos that are demonetized but dont give the creator any of the revenue. Remember the good old days when there werent any ads on YouTube and people could do it just for fun and be genuine people? Most of the current users are probably too young for that, given the fact that were trying to make the platform appeal to the absolute lowest common denominators and everything must be family friendly. Parents, YouTube is not your babysitter. Spend some time with your kids. YouTube, police your content properly and stop pushing your missteps and lawsuits on to innocent creators so they take the fall for your malpractice. Your new streaming is a disaster and has no transparency for the creators who use it. Dont even get me started on the latest changes with the algorithms. Recommending things from over a decade ago thats entirely irrelevant to what I watch, pushing political advertisements and videos into my suggestions, not showing my my subscriptions and instead putting more promoted content where I go to try to watch the people I actually come on to YouTube to watch, just more of corporate BS because cable is dying and we have to plaster more unfunny British talk show hosts somewhere. Your community guidelines and selective enforcements are terrible, the way you treat your users is terrible, the way you do advertising and the way your algorithms work has been a joke since the start. Make YouTube great again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty good I guess. Of course there are ads and you have to pay to get rid of them, but it has fewer ads than most streaming apps for music plus it not only has music it has a lot of variety (it probably has the most variety of videos than any other app) - I have even watched entire movies on there. Some free movies they have are so underrated. And you can easily make playlists so you can read or whatever without having to constantly go back and forth like Spotify. And its not just a streaming thing, you can connect to people, meet people, create a username that isnt even your name- be yourself. There are so many options.But there are downsides. The thing that bothers me the most is how heavily monitored the comments are. I feel as though I can not speak my mind. I understand that there are laws about no speech that incites violence, but whats wrong with a little political debate? And although I do not upload videos, I feel like YouTube takes too many videos down. A lot of times it says it has something to do with not being available in a country or some bs. I know several countries outside of the US are have way more limits about what they can watch and do, but Im American so why should I be restricted like them? (No offense to anyone living in those kind of countries- I feel sorry for you) And theres been so many incidents where I like several videos but they suddenly get deleted by either YouTube or that channel. I wish I could at least find out what it was that got deleted. Its good about telling you why it gets deleted, but it never tells you what you liked that got deleted. If youre anything like me- youve probably liked well over 100 videos and thats certainly too many to remember the names of every single one of them which is why I wish I could at least know the title of what got deleted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The business of suppressing free speech. YouTube hides, demonetizes and deletes videos of conservative voices who have every right to express their opinions in a platform like this. YouTube favors liberals, transgenders, illegal immigration, over American interests. Its a shame that such an excellent media has fallen so low to favor one side. YouTube must be apolitical. Period.YouTube also infringes on basic freedoms that we, Americans, cherish such as freedom of speech, assembly, our right to bear arms, all in their failed efforts to change our values and impose their communist agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Google needs to stop censoring people they disagree with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy security threat. YouTube hasnt been patched in months becauseGoogle refuses to disclose how they harvest your personal data via Apple guidelines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Far-left propaganda machine that took over a video hosting service. Between removing dislikes so that bad content creators get a leg-up on deceiving the consumer, to the direct promotion of black supremacy (and the nonstop get jabbed spam) this service is nearly unusable despite having a historically established monopoly on video content-creators of (seemingly) all types. Google needs to face true and violent justice one day for the practice of government and election manipulation, among many, many other ethical violations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube is great if you need someone to decide what your little fragile mind can handle. This has turned into blatant censorship.More corporate garbage. I cant handle how many dislikes my video is getting Please, disable the dislike feature Google Protect my precious feelings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could be much better. YouTube censors way too often and its primarily far right content that gets removed. Too many ads for progressive and immoral agenda content is messed up. YouTube died back when it was sold. This is just some other app that purchased the name. Only thing keeping me around is that it is still free for basic use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Would be better its censorship was appropriate. YouTube is a great platform for entertainment, education and learning. The wealth of ideas shared by contributors is nothing short of outstanding. For many, this platform replaces main stream media for news and current events. For others, it allows them to build a platform to share their expertise with a wider audience, and take some share in the wealth generated by this outlet. However, Youtube has entered into the world of big tech censorship when ideas dont conform to an official or particular narrative. I understand that standards have a place, but Im concerned that these values only appear to apply to Youtubers of a particular political leaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. YouTube is great if youre political views align with theirs, if not then content youre interested in gets deleted because YouTube doesnt believe in freedom of speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I dont like the censorship. I dont like how YouTube censors stuff that they dont agree with. I dont need a morally bankrupt company that has zero ethics tell me how I should think. Its clear that YouTube is a wildly, radicalized and just a flat out racist company that thinks minorities are ignorant fools. Shame on you YouTube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censorship. There is no benefit to anyone from restricting information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring content. Shame on the company whose motto used to be Do no evil.Do no evil indeed. Youtube is censoring content and demonetizing creators.  Lets help stop this by using apps like BitChute and Odysee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suppression of freedom. Speech is not the core value of YouTube. YouTube doesnt get to pick what we listen to and how people express themselves. Canceling my YouTube membership today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Stop censoring free speech both political and religious. YouTube should be deplatformed and legally sanctioned for violating first amendment rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why YouTube???. 1) Comments need to be put back at the bottom of the page.2) Thumbnails are way way to LARGE It ruins the aesthetics of, Creators Thumbnails Plus it limits, how many Videos, or Livestreams, are Recommended 3) YouTube App crashes to much Before the last update, after the App Crashed...you would get a pop-up asking, Would you like to resume, what you were Watching? Which I was okay with, especially because I didnt lose who I was Watching Now you get kicked when the YouTube App crashes. When you re-open the App, you have to search for who you were Watching I believe that is totally unacceptable4) I pay for YouTube Premium, therefore I expect better Service Although I feel that even if People dont pay for YouTube Premium, they deserve a voice as Well. I see hundreds, upon hundreds of People requesting that you put the Comments back where they were...Why is it so difficult to listen to the users? Thats my reason for 3 Stars  - After some improvements, I would definitely update my Review My 2nd major problem is when a Creator has literally come for their Previous Subscribers by cursing them, defamation of said Subscribers Character, said Creator had a Channel TERMINATED for breaking YouTubes TOS. Why is this particular Creator, allowed to keep on Cyber Bullying, continued Harassment, without any Consequences?? I have reported 3-4 times to YouTube &amp; Team YouTube without any results. These Streams are still on this Creators Channel I guarantee if I Posted the things this Creator has said about me, you at YouTube would Punish me, in some kind of way?Im NOT the only Person that this Creator is Cyber Bullying, Harassing, and Defaming of Character Id appreciate if this matter, can be looked into? Thank you so much for your time and Help, hopefully?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Care about your users first. Ill give this app 5 stars when they allow for Picture in Picture. I dont know what kind of war theyre at with Apple over this but no reason to let users suffer. I would also say that YouTube should have a tiered system for their paid service (I.e if I just want certain features like getting rid of ads or the ability to play while the phone is locked, I can just pay for those). But we all know google just cares about the dollar bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censoring is not cool. YouTube has to stop censoring people who have conservative views, its not right and counter productive to what the USA stands for. I agree, free speech is the most essential aspect to a Free society. YouTube is is doing the best job at this but improvements can be made. That being said this is a great app for entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get it Together Google. Its become very clear that YouTube/Google care more about their advertising partners than they do their content creators.People are leaving the site everyday, but YouTube doesnt care as long as they get a cut from ad revenue. They even go as far as to place ads on videos their system has demonitized so they can still line their pockets.Its too late for them to course correct now, so itll be interesting to see where people start to go to post their content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and adverts. Still having to suffer adverts in my location is affecting my overall experience. More importantly the continued meddling by YouTube to censor people such as David icke and label them as far right or spreading hate is non-sense. Youtube has become a platform of the far left and promotes communism and forced diversity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop censoring. YouTube, we are a country built on Democracy and freedom of speech. Please stop deleting accounts that are speaking the truth and restricting freedom of speech. It is not a good look on you.We want to keep enjoying your platform.Thank you,Concerned American",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I Came Here To Escape The Ads on TV. I love YouTube (and only discovered its full potential around 5 years ago)how much entertainment you can have learning about people, their lives, their opinions and their skills. Since adpocalpse the platform has changed, in the last two years it has changed beyond recognition. Ads two at a time and most longer than the videos, censorship (for the wrong types of content) just soul destroying. You cant give an opinion on whats going on in the world(that we are all living through, its our real experiences and thoughts on those experiences), if its different from the norm you are penalised. Yet some of the Huge youtubers get away with, at times disgusting and disturbing content available to kids and are NEVER challenged.  eg The Ace Family, 8 passengers and Trisha Paytas, the worst offenders. People that are being allowed to use their platforms to ruin other creators lives, reputations just because you let them? Creators (using that term loosely in a lot of these cases)allowed to extort money from their followers That is soul destroying.  You need to employ a modern day Mary Whitehouse to clean up and promote good behaviour and that greed is wrong, extortion is wrong. Live feed where tips are given, should be limited to twice a year, most charities are losing out because of this mercenary practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. I only am keeping YouTube, for my daughters. Why 1 star? When important issues of our time are censored to support a certain  narrative. No honest conversations can be discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship galore. YouTube is another big company with a great idea that is poorly executed.  YouTube prioritizes censoring debate and non-left opinions, and protecting their corporate interests by shielding them from criticism.YouTube is free and you get what you pay for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop unfair censoring practices. Stop censoring only certain types of content, it is very biased that you apply rules to some channels but not others. And stop spamming me with your family plan or ad free YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube protecting bad contents. YouTube made a very poor decision of hiding the dislikes on their videos protecting lies and bad contents from being easily highlighted.Im definitely gonna reduced my access to the app from now on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Way to much censorship, its not what users want. Sorry to say that after years of enjoying YouTube and its community, YouTube has continuously made the decision to censor and promote harmful propaganda and Im looking for a new video platform. They are supposed to be a platform, not a propaganda machine. They suffocate channels that they dont agree with, they ban, cancel and put up propaganda banners on everything. Its bullying and Im sick of it. I know many YouTubers make their livelihoods here and cant leave. Its very sad that they are subject to this platform. At this point YouTube pretty much has a monopoly on the video platform business, there arent really any places to pack up and go yet. Rumble is growing fast and I recommend it but we need more creators to setup their shop their even if they dont leave YT. YouTube needs to shape up or loose out. What they are doing is wrong and I cant stay to passively support the bullying anymore. Im so sad but I believe Im doing the right thing. We all deserve better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have about had it with Google products across the board. Im getting a little sick of google censoring literally everything I do with their products Theyre not posting Business reviews or YouTube commentsGoogle shows you that theyre posted but in reality nobody else can see them. I have no idea why Google does this none of the comments/reviews are threatening or overly offensive, this is censorship in the United States of America. I realize there a private company and they have the right to do whatever they want with their products but the Internet can be considered as public domain and even necessary to exist in the modern world from now on Im going to be using another search engine and where I can limit the interaction I deal with Google products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censorship. Google is big tech censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YouTube needs to stop censorship. YouTube and Google needs to stop censoring conservative groups and channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Less politically and monopoly-motivated censorship please. I hope YouTube leadership will have courage and take broad minded fairness-motivated action to lead out with allowing those with alternative perspectives to have a voice on their platform. Sensor with care and fairness - only after hearing the petitions and professional objections raised by those posting the content. Thank you for considering this crucial principle of a free society which allowed you to develop. Please do the same for others and resist the temptation that leads to tyrant and oppression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Enemy of the People. Youtube is vastly becoming the enemy of the people. Censoring, and the deletion of channels and alternate viewpoints has become so rampant that its completely obvious that Youtube has become an enemy of the people. What was once an environment for creativity, information and laughter has become nothing more than a music video site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mixed feelings. I love the content on YouTube, and the various channels but I dont tolerate censorship and fake fact checkers , all the sensitivity in this new era has to stop, people should be allowed to always express how they feel or state their opinions. People are intelligent enough to decide what is right and do their own research. I understand YouTube tries to take down videos that dont support their hidden agenda, were fully aware who the owners of YouTube are and how factual information that is backed up by science is being taken down, so I feel people need to hear the truth and not some water downed lies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just some criticism. I like many features about YouTube, but there are clear problems that can all stem from bad management or a poor system, these problems include but are not limited to: problem 1 I dislike the way they treat there creators which may I remind you are the life blood of the app whether its butchering their videos taking add revenue unjustly. problem 2 selecting the dont recommend channel option does virtually nothing, this on its own is a very minor problem, but combined with the fact that the recommendation section is awful at recommending content that users will like can make many users upset. Problem 3 Its very creepy that apps like YouTube tracks what you do on there site, and target adds based on what you watch, but it also is inaccurate for example I have never touched a vape or a cigarette in my life or even watched content of people who have but I just keep getting adds for discouraging vaping aggressively, I understand that vaping is very bad for your health, I got that from the first anti vaping add, but by the way to get someone to stop vaping is not by force, if anything there only making the process of quitting more difficult. Problem 4 this is a minor problem but it still is one, I dislike that they frequently update the app but never tell us how its being updated which makes me assume the updates dont actually change anything. Problem 5 I despise how YouTubes system favors click bait content like content from Logan Paul or Morgz. Because they have so many subscribers there content which should clearly be demonetized stays on the page, may I remind you that his primary demographic is 8 year olds, its sad to know that content like this posted on smaller channels would instantly be taken down. With huge apps like YouTube its hard to feel like youre complaints are being heard YouTube please fix at least one fo these problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too many ads, misinformation. This is fine for adults who know how to sift through all the ads, garbage, misinformation, hate mongering, etc. You can definitely find some useful, informative, and unbiased content. I would say it\'s terrible for kids though, who can\'t yet filter out the nonsense. You might might say that\'s what youtube kids is for, but the problem is that when YT is on all the other devices in the household, it can be nearly impossible to block access to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What privacy?. A truly flawed and pathetic data privacy policy. You really cant get out of Spotify tracking or selling your data. I pay for their service per month. Its time for Spotify (and others) to pay a monthly fee to subscribers for the use of their personal data, or offer complete opt out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great music, awful privacy violations. I pay spotify monthly, but they still collect and sell my personally identifiable information. There seems to be no way to opt out of this in the app. I will be canceling and moving to a different service that doesnt secretly spy on me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Privacy. Im deleting the app because Spotify tracks me too much. I can tell from the ads that they know when Im driving, when Im doing homework, or when Im doing something else. I tried turning off location and microphone access, but the app still knows. I dont like it and its creepy. I also get ads because I dont have premium, which is fine. But I dont like the number of offensive/controversial ads I keep getting for gambling and contraception. Again, deleting the app. Its a shame because I do like the music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Id Give it a SIX, until I found out about. spotifystats.com. Data theives. So sad. Did you ACTUALLY READ spotifystats.com Privacy Policy?? I cant even find my own spotify data without connecting to that sketcky as all get out website. That info is ours, just because I didnt read Spotifys lengthy eula this is what you get. Sketchy, what else is your company doing??? Bye, enjoy my data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Violation of Privacy. Ive used and loved Spotify for years. Wonderful study tool, but recently it has been extremely glitchy which had me considering canceling my subscription. Then I learned that Spotify had received the rights to listen in on users? What? Spotify has no right to listen in on me and my surroundings to gain information on my whereabouts and personality. Thats violation of privacy in my book. Goodbye subscription, goodbye Spotify. Very disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I DO NOT AGREE with your company policies. REMOVING Spotify. Removing Spotify I REFUSE to use or do business with ANY company thst publishes CONservative lies and DISINFORMATION on Covid 19 that can cost innocent American lives. I will NOT use your service again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This review may or may not be censored. TLDR.. Spotify proliferates Oppression and Gate-keeps ownership for minorities. This app is not your friend. Think of it as a corporate spy, only around to infiltrate and collect. Its designed with your manufactured consent in mind. Things that aid your cause are slowly removed from circulation. The end goal being: turning you into a mindless consuming yes man.And I have yet to get started on the company ethicsSome of you may be familiar with the Joe Budden podcast (from the urban[syn. Black, Hip, Cool] culture), and many only have the app due to his platform being presented exclusively on Spotify.Ill cut to the chase.. Spotify is a gatekeeper in what we call Corporate Capitalism, or what is now being widely recognized as Institutional Oppression or Systemic Racism.Joe Budden made Spotify and set the stage for them to sign Joe Rogan, Michelle Obama, and many other huge stars to exclusive deals. Although he is a big part of the reason Spotify is at a healthy stock price today, he cant share in the glory because he isn&#39;t a Caucasian.So, yeah Spotify is convenient, they positioned themselves as one of the middlemen for Music/Podcasts. Just here to bring attention to what we give up for the sake of convenience.. So I must ask you... Do you stand with oppression? I dont want to unknowingly or knowingly support the oppression of others. &amp;For this reason I rate this app 5 stars for convenience but 0 stars for MORALITY &amp; INTEGRITY.I may have not spoken well enough for you to receive my message, so please do your own research. Start with Joe Buddens Podcast (Views From the SPOT and the following episode Squatty Poddy)I for one will uninstall this app on all my devices AS SOON AS JOE BUDDEN COMPLETES HIS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. AND I WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL SPOTIFY CLARIFIES THEIR POSITION ON MINORITY OWNERSHIP AND FAIR REVENUE SHARING PRACTICES. I URGE you to so the same.ONE LOVE - Your Fellow Man",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not responsible. Distributors of media have an obligation to not tolerate the distribution of false and/or harmful information. Spotify continues to neglect this responsibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom. Pleased that Spotify allows consenting views. I do not need to be spoon fed by self proclaimed experts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify forcing Paid Customers to Allow Tracking Bad. I am not quite sure why Apple has approved a new feature on the Spotify App that forces Paid Customers to allow tracking under the heading You are in Control. Apple is now colluding with Spotify to Track Customers. If Apple is the gate keeper for reviewing and approving these apps why did they approve this new feature that DOES NOT GIVE US THE OPTION TO SAY NO TO TRACKING. INSTEAD THE APP YOU HAVE TO TURN THE APP OFF AND BACK ON TO GET RID OF THIS CONSTANT ANNOYING POP UP FEATURE. APPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED THIS INVASION OF PRIVACY. SIMILAR TO ALL OTHER FEATURES APPLE HAS REQUIRED APPS TO ASK FOR PERMISSION AND ALLOW THE CUSTOMERS TO SAY NO OR YES. TO opt in or out. Now with Spotify we the customers are NOT GIVEN the choice in Spotify pop up Tracking Notifications. INSTEAD IT WANT YOU TO FIRST OPT IN THE. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO TRY AND OPT OUT. I DONT CARE WHAT YOU FORCE FREE CUSTOMERS TO DO IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY SPOTIFY GIVING ADD FILLED MUSIC. I however DO CARE that IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT WE ARE PAYING SPOTIFY FOR ADD FREE MUSIC AND CONTENT. NOW We ARE FOCED TO ALLOW TRACKING. THIS IS WRONG AND SPOTIFY AND APPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR APPROVING THIS INVASION OF CUSTOMERS PRIVACY IN A VERY DECEPTIVE MANNER OF CONTROL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy. If Spotify cared about user privacy it would get 5 stars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Responsibility. Spotify needs to take responsibility for the nonsense it permits on its site,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop default public sharing - let users set privacy. Like the app, hate the way Spotify forces default privacy to sharing activity. Even if you set it to private, Spotify changes your privacy settings back to public sharing. Seriously Spotify- those are not the value of a company that respects privacy. Change that setting to respect privacy like every other legitimate company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify needs to set. And follow a policy protecting its users from disinformation , especially health and medical. Rogan Experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok App but poor enforcement of rules. The application itself seems to work ok but the issue is the content that they carry. Spotify has policies, recently made public, for what is acceptable content. Unfortunately some of their content creators, particularly exclusive ones, seem to get a pass and are above the rules. This speaks to the ethics of the company and I will not do business with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. I deleted the Spotify app from my phone today because I cannot support any platform censoring their customers speech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Selective censorship. I guess only certain people are allowed to be censored on Spotify. Let me know when your censorship is applied equally to everyone or, even better, dont censor things that arent against the law in America. Youre not the moral police.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sensoring. If Spotify decides to start censoring conservatives, I will NOT hesitate to cancel this app. This censoring has got to stop  This is not the America I know, where people have freedom of speech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They lock you in. No way to download or backup my data (playlists, etc.) No way to pause or delete your account without having to contact their customer service. I hate apps that docthis, in fact I believe it\'s illegal since GDPR Also, GET RID OF ROGAN and his lies and misinformation Shame on you Spotify",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify selectively chooses who is censored and can not be trusted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify employees are censoring certain views that don&#39;t align with their politics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selling my data?. Worried about Spotifys personal data usage and data sharing. Just saw a list that had them near the top on sharing data with third parties. Might have to switch back to Apple. Hate to see something like this in an App I also have to pay for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Extremely restrictive for user preferences. What started as an amazing service and app, has been slowly been degrading with an importance on the algorithm. So important in fact that they no longer allow you to remove songs from your recently played, which has a HUGE impact in the overall experience of the service and app. I am reposting my post from the Spotify community forums, because they have been ignored, and maybe this will get it seen:It&#39;s a shame such basic functionality is not implemented, for whatever corporate goal is trying to be met. Every other platform has this functionality, which I am seriously considering making the effort to switch to, regardless of the 8+ years of playlists and saves on Spotify. That&#39;s how egregious it is NOT to be able to remove recently played track. It ruins the total experience.I really hope Spotify investors see core users, who have been using Spotify PREMIUM for years, leaving the platform over these personalization restrictions it puts on users to control what they want to see or listen to. Basically, if you consider any media platform&#39;s foundation, one that at least has the user in mind, would allow for such a simple functionality. It&#39;s obvious based on the community forums that the user is in fact NOT who this is being designed for, but rather to garner nice-looking statistics for Spotify management and investors.You make us, the users, feel dumb by doing this. Are we indeed that daft that you can&#39;t trust us with our tastes? Please consider this sentiment as a broad feeling among the user base (among conversations that happen OUTSIDE these forums).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify>censorship. Keep it open, and free. Do not censor opinions. Thanks, hope you keep it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy policy changes. Spotify is changing its privacy policy so it can use your mic and listen to you. Time to deactivate and delete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dodgy ads that grab data?. Why is the government working with Spotify to make playlists? Dont they have better things to do? Clicked on find out more and frankly didnt find out much more. Saw the Revoke Access button at the bottom of the screen which told me that Id have to go into my account to revoke access to my account for the Government/Spotify app. Honestly? For clicking, find out more? Thats just creepy. I havent time to find out why this happened or mess about revoking access for apps that I didnt explicitly give consent for access to in the first place. It was much faster to ditch Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify tracking and restrictions. I downloaded Spotify so that I could listen to joe Rogans podcast and now Spotify has announced restrictions on free speech. We listen to information in many forms to learn and form our own opinion and if it is restricted by censors and regulations to it then informed decisions can no longer be made because one side to the argument is restricted and what remains can only be termed as a form of propaganda without its balance. Even if the opposition is wrong it still has a right to be heard and if it is indeed wrong then the arguments and proof from the correct side will prevail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Issues. I hate that this app tracks you with your your permission and it uses your contact info and more like facial idinity and it uses your personal information and it is trying to get peoples information without confermino it is ok to do so it also uses usage data and identifiers as well and other things to track you as well like search history and more like finaisail plans and other plans low your data plan your cell phone plan and more and there are lots of adds also they use lots of third parties to track you by using your contact information your search history and your location and money financial plan and other scketchy third party information and I think they should ask your permission before they get all of your information and if they dont have your permission then they should keep it private. Also, I think that it should not take up so much i phone data. And not play so many adds and they should have a plan that includes Nba tv youtube tv Permount plus Disney plus and MLB tv and sling. I hate the limit of 6 skips and other than these major issues the app is a good great amazing ausome app for music. I also hate that it uses app digonises to track you. I hate that most apps for music like YouTube, I heart, Pandora, Spotify, and prime music use third party information to track you. I think this is really frustrating. I also think that Spotify could do a better job about playing adds that are not stupid movie trailers that some people can care less about. I dont like any of the adds on Spotify except for the basketball and other sports adds and holiday adds. Please fix these bugs and glitches and majure. Thanks. I also hate the shoe adds and food adds and pet adds and other adds that are not interested in like the toy adds I like the music adds though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify would be better if they wouldnt sensor your music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Curating content. I will not use an application which censors based on political thought. Due to actions recently taken by Spotify I will delete app and no longer use the service or any affiliates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unresponsible content oversight. You have a responsibility to oversee and prevent misinformation being disseminated.  The fact that you have invested heavily in an individual who does exactly that is abhorrent. I am a new to Spotify but will no longer continue. There are other more ethical options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Honda and Spotify love violating our privacy. Its so creepy how on my radio in my car I listen to country music and the Spotify app without me ever listening to country on their app, somehow knew I like country music. My assumption is that the guys at Spotify figured out how to use the voice recorder and a little bit of neural networks to actually record for key words when they use your voice recording hardware without openly acknowledging the fact that they do so. Its so creepy how people talk about Facebook ads and Alexa listening to us without our consent and yet the application could not possibly have known that I enjoy country without violating my privacy. (Your privacy). Strange, very very peculiar, indeed. I mean my background is only in computer science so I mean for what its worth I suppose mine is a working theory about privacy of the average user. Amazing App",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep our freedom. As long as Spotify keeps our freedoms, I will be a forever customer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Potential service to replace you tube. Never Censor Seriously EVER no matter whatCopy the user experience and video search style of YouTube, the closer the better with the great exception of NO CENSORSHIP I cant stress that enough.Why do you require personal information to start a spotify account?? This stopped me from using your service for a long time. Thank you,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. I absolutely love Spotify, but I really really hate that your family plan is only for family in the same household. Not only is it a privacy violation, but its a stupid policy. Netflix offers a family plan and they dont have that ridiculous policy. Your platform is amazing and lots of artist are featured and have the desire to be on here, but dont forget competition is what keeps a company great. If I hear someone else offers the same quality of music with no nonsense to it, Ill be more than happy to give my business to the best business. Overall 4 stars for your incredible platform, but you lost a star for whoever made such a foolish rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Protecting Freedom of Speech. Spotify is one of the only apps that I trust to protect people from being censored or cancelled. They stand up against the fringe minority who believe nobody deserves a voice if it goes against their beliefs and uses monetary threats to achieve this goal. You should continue this and understand that most people are behind you. Everyone deserves to have a voice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Split decision. SpotifySo far is doing the right thing not censoring peoples opinions and FACTs. I appreciate them not catering to imbecilic people that dont know how to read statistics. Some people just want to speak before they learn anything. I love Spotify. I pay for the family plan. If Spotify starts getting into politics and removing people because of their political points of view they are going to lose a third to half of their subscriptions I will be one of them. I dare anyone to find something that Joe Rogan has said on his podcast that does not lineup with scientific evidence. Point it out to me and I will be happy to tell you where youre wrong. To cancel your account because somebody said something you dont agree with instead of just blocking that person its just stupidity. Again I love Spotify I will continue to use Spotify as long as they dont try to get political.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely useless unless youre stuck in the states. I travel the world and this app is absolutely useless because I cant even listen to a simple podcast unless Im stuck in the states. How dumb is that? Luckily I have Pocket Casts so I dont need to use this ad machine. Unfortunately they just bought out my favorite podcast so I cant listen to it freely anymore. (The only reason I tried this horrible app) It is now an exclusive so they will now be losing all their international listeners. Luckily there are many more podcasts out there that dont require this limited app to listen. Spotify is the worst.Why would you want to use an app that you have to be ball and chained to the internet to use? With Pocket Casts I dont need to be logged in each time. Youre free to just use it No restrictions, no tethering. I can just download what I want when I do get internet access and then can take hours of podcasts wherever I go as I travel. This app model is so trapping and restrictive. Climbing a mountain, deep in a jungle? No You need to log in to do this crap lol Would not want to have to use an app like this So glad Im free to listen to things the way I want on Pocket Cast and not trapped into Spotify.Dont even get me started on streaming music with these apps and finicky license agreements People need to realize with these apps that they no longer own music and arent free to enjoy it whatever way they like. Buy your favorite music as .mp3 files so theyre fully yours. Always. All my music was bought and paid for and I keep it on my SD card (android user, only on here to review this app on iTunes too) and can listen it it any time I want wherever I want in any player I want because it is mine. Anything streamed must be chained to the internet and the service can yank your favorite content any time it feels like it or for legal reasons, and then you lose access to it. Nope. Ill keep my purchases and freedom to do what I want with them and not rely on these streaming traps. If you dont own the actual file, you can lose your content any time because its not really yours. Youre paying to access it on these peoples servers as long as they want to keep it accessible and they can remove it or modify it at any time. Nope No stream traps for me Ill keep MY content and use it how I like",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsiderate. Spotify uses your data even when you turn data off on your phone for Spotify unless you turn on Offline in your settings. This is inconsiderate and hostile as they are overriding a setting on your phone. My data usage has gone up because of this feature. Your app should not have the ability to override the mobile device settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy features lacking. Music is a personal experience and if Spotify is going to maintain a follower type platform they need to implement the unfollow/block option. So many users are requesting this, why has this not been added after years of requests?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify needs to get their act together. I am deleting your App and will suggest to people on all media platforms that they do the same.This is in response to an obvious lack of concern about public safety allowing content providers to spread misinformation on Spotify.Get it together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of speech. I I just downloaded Spotify because it is one of the last few platforms that isnt censoring, which sadly is a rarity these days So crazy considering this is the United States. Thankful for Spotify",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regulate whats on the platform. Spotify needs to regulate whats on their platform. Joe Rogan is spreading miss-information which is getting people sick and in some cases dead. Regardless of how good the platform was for music I cannot back their company until they do something about their regulations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify broadcasting false information. Spotify is supporting dis-information. It is doing nothing to u if your country but to allow the decay of democracy. I can no longer associate with this company and will remove my subscription.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forced Info Sharing?. I love my Spotify, but every time I try to use it I get a pop-up that I cant get past asking me to allow tracking to receive relevant Spotify promotions and marketing. The only choice is to CHOOSE. Where is the button to deny or choose NOT to share. I pay $100 a year for this app. Why cant I say NO?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Spotify supports censorship, its simple as that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nazi AF. Spotify used to be as dope as it could be and they keep trying to restrict the user... Its gotten so bad that the account my wife and I have shared forever can only be used on one device at a time... I really would appreciate if they would lighten up and stop restricting access... if we each want to have listen to the songs weve save we have to A.make a new account.... Im done writing this... after my premium ends Ill definitely be deleting the app if this isnt something that changes...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify needs to take responsibility for spreading misinformation. Verified Misinformation is not ok.  Spotify must spend the money to identify and remove content regardless of the cost to their bottom line-it is their responsibility to the people on the receiving end.  Just like the enforced requirements for food production in this country-you cant put lead in food just because it would make it sweet and you could sell more per pound - you need to enforce your requirements for content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Private Profile. I really like this app. Its nice that the only price for listening to all my favorite songs is watching ads, like how great is that. I really appreciate how easy it is to make albums and I like that Spotify will recommend songs they feel would nicely compliment the vibe of the album. One thing I would like for Spotify to update however, is the privacy of your profile. I would like the option to make my profile private and be able to accept/decline people who want to follow me like on other social media platforms. Privacy is a really important thing for me and I love listening to music on this app but Im more cautious now of which playlists are public, knowing that anyone could see them. Thank you for everything Spotify, just would like an update that would make a private profile available .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify is racist, sexist and transphobic. As is evident by the company it keeps. I will not indulge them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad practices. I will not use Spotify as long as they invite and support racist language and behaviors. Apparently they dont respect POC and I no longer respect Spotify. My money is Black and so am I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi. I enjoy using your app but you might wish to add extra security because Ive had trouble with hackers and from reading the data they were trying to use Spotify in order to track me by imbedding tracking in the music images of which I believe are copyrighted keeping my comment anonymously unnamed because Im formerly a DV victim. Thanks once again. Not sure why this isnt sending through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personally Offensive. I find it incredibly personally offensive that such a fine listening situation as Spotify would without my asking politicize my listening by giving me Barack Obamas playlist as well as Michelle Obamas playlist as well as Michelle Obamas podcast as well as Oprah Winfreys podcast  I absolutely HATE going on Spotify and the first thing thats in my face its something that I dont want, because it is a political personality instead of music that I would like or l have chosen for me. I believe you need to easily put in place something for people to request anything that has to do with a political personality.I dont like the fact that I could not go on any area of your site and locate a way to contact Spotify to please ask you to remove this for me.So what did I do?I tweeted it and I complained,I put it on websites+the MANY groups of musicians that I belong to and I complained. I put it on Facebook and I complained. But there was no way that I could just simply ask Spotify to remove it. However I very much enjoyed my 2020 live, but was incredibly disappointed to see that you guys decided to take that down. Id like it back,but thats probably not possible, so I really do think that you should give listeners some way to keep it.l know that it is possible for you guys to give us subscribers a way to contact Spotify when we have an issue that is not limited to the ones that you given us. Thank you very much, and I would really appreciate a reply to these issues because my entire family uses Spotify (in fact my son got your service right after it came to the US and got it on the ground floor.) Thank you for giving me this opportunity to contact you...Sincerely,Jane Morris",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Block feature??. Id raise my rating by a star if there was a block feature. I want my friends to be able to listen with me, without having to worry about specific people who I dont trust being able to track my listening habits. It would mean a lot if Spotify could support my privacy to this small extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unaware of malicious share groups. This app has a lot of options that can be a serious problem to your devices from people who take control your devices. And actually modify the Spotify intellectual property. This is insane to be not allowed to unsubscribe or delete the app off your device. I found that they use old apps to execute there control over your identity and the knowledge of certain personal info that you think would be safe. How are they using my device after it&#39;s deleted is not sharing , I wanna know who I&#39;m dealing with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censoring people. The Spotify platform is not good because you all put ideology before first amendment right. Post the Joe Rogan with Alex Jones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free Speech. Spotify has violated the US Constitution and limited free speech on its platform. Very disappointed that tech companies feel the need to limit free speech. 0 stars, company deserves to go bankrupt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I have cancelled my family subscription due to Spotifys decision to censor content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My data. My data really be suffering even when Im not using Spotify, this app be stealing my data.Other than that, its ok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censored SPOTIFY. A good platform serves its users. When Spotify censors what I can access, it is time to censor Spotify. Ive deleted the Spotify App and will NEVER listen to their music or podcasts again. Free Speech is the critical topic here. Do what you can, with what you have, and do it now. -Theodore Roosevelt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop misinformation. Canceling my Spotify due to the misinformation you allow on your platform. As a multi-million company you have an obligation to thoroughly investigate and fact-check the information that is shared via Spotify. However, you have continuously ignored the concerns of government and medical officials. Shame on you. Will be switching to a streaming service that has morals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censors content. Would rather watch my content with no censorship. Left Spotify to find a music streaming service that just streams. Ill filter my own content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of speech. To my fellow music lovers, use your speech to let Spotify know what your values are by canceling your account and switching to Apple Music or Tidal. I support freedom of speech when it doesnt cost people their lives. 270 medical professionals have penned an open letter telling Spotify that by continuing to host Rogan, they are contributing to unnecessary death. Spotify looks the other way. This isnt about cancel culture, this is about taking the microphone away from those who promote lies, mistrust and hate. To think that Facebook of all companies holds the higher ground thats really saying something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Maybe Id be more supportive and approving of Spotify if they didnt compromise their values of free speech due to mob pressure Costing Joe Rogan 100 of his episodes, limiting content, and putting out flags and captions pointing to forced narratives instead of open information and discourse is extremely nauseating and disappointing definitely not what I thought an app was supposed to have the right to do. Another one bites the dust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fully private account feature. Love this app and everything about it but I was wondering if you guys could include a feature where you can make your Spotify account completely private. I know you have the option to make your playlist secret and have a private listening session but I think users should have the option to make their accounts fully private if they choose to especially for privacy and safety reasons because I dont want random strangers or other users to have the right to listen to my personal playlists because what I listen to is my personal music preferences and I feel that I should be able to keep it that way I hope you guys will consider this option and implicate it into the app thank you ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorphip. Spotify is moving into government sponsored censorship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Signing out until you improve your misinformation policy. I stand with the artists that have brought to light Spotifys continued hosting of information that is anti-science and a threat to public health.  No more listening to music or paid advertisements until it is clear that Spotify is willing to be a responsible member of the global community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship has got to stop. As Spotify is now removing and labeling and informing what is or is not correct think. I for one will not stand for it. Goodbye Spotify until yall get your act together. Im not paying for yall to help me with dis or misinformation or warn me of anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I dont like that Spotify can use your mic to listen to what is happening in the room in order to pick the next song I am going to delete app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify supports censorship and the video playback is terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify. Rien ne peut legaler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Needs urgent update. Still a lot of songs that are not on it, especially covers of songs etc, but overall it works well, apart from one glaringly obvious problem.  There is no way to make your profile private? There have been news articles about Spotifys lack of a private mode and cases where a girl was harassed by an abusive ex who was stalking her listening activity, yet Spotify seems to think this is not important. I dont think many people realise just how public there profile is and how all their listening activity is publicly broadcasted to anyone who wants to know it. I dont understand why this is still an issue. I understand that they want it public so it helps people find new songs easier but surely we should get the choice of if we want to share what we listen to...Please , please fix this and I will give five stars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy violations. Im using the app on iPhone, and only played videos on my iPad which doesnt even have Spotify installed. Somehow the Spotify app installed on my phone is able to track the browsing history and my YouTube playlist from my iPad to make a recommendation on podcast. This is unacceptable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Comment. We need tighter security options when it comes to spotify, i've had many ppl try to hack into my account. Give us a 2 step verification option, to keep our minds at ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is ran bye Commies. Theyre censoring free speechThat should never be acceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STOP selling MY data. Ive been a paying customer for close to 5 years. Spotify has continued to track more data every year even though Im paying for the service. Dont you love it when free services justify privacy invasion to keep their service free while others make you pay with cash AND your privacy. Stop pushing podcasts and audiobooks on me. New audiobooks should not take up 1/5 of my Home Screen when Ive never listened to one. Im leaving Spotify the moment Apple Music reaches feature and UI parity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im censoring Spotify. I have censored Spotify be canceling my subscription and deleting the app from my phone. They want to censor then I will do the same to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bull$hit. Spotify has won a patent enabling it to snoop on users speech & background noise in order to gauge emotional states & location to serve an appropriate soundtrack. Information will be used (hypothetically) to pick the perfect song w/ out requiring conscious input from users as inputting details of their own tastes & preferences was asking too much of the platforms average user  (consumes valuable time that could be spent streaming music).Spotify will be able to pinpoint users age, gender, and will analyze their voice for intonation, stress, rhythm & the likes of units of speech to determine emotional state. App will also pick up environmental metadata.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free Speech + Awesome Music Discovery. I love how much music is available to meet through this app. If I forget to queue a song it will play a radio based off of my music and I end up finding out about a bunch of new music. I also love that Spotify stands for free-speech. People should have the freedom to make their own decisions based off what information is presented to them. most people will make the right decision or draw a conclusion that best suits them and their beliefs. You cannot control what a person thinks, it is entirely up to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Science & Health > Ratings. DELETING SPOTIFY APP Spotify, you need to understand that peoples lives are not worth ratings, downloads, subscriptions, or clicks. You just sold out peoples health and safety so you could keep a strung out, steroidal a-hole on your payroll. You should be ashamed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The right thing to do. Not at all sorry to leave Spotify.  Unacceptable to see a corporation completely fail at regulating content.  Very disappointing.  Let the Spotify death rattle begin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free Speech, No Censorship. As long as Spotify doesnt start censoring speech, I will be a customer. The app is great. However, the moment I see Spotify taking actions like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to suppress free thought, I will leave the platform permanently and encourage others to do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Those who control information rule the world. Eff Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify is Wrong. Still enjoy the music, cant stand the policies. All for the mighty $$$.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech. I will continue  to use Spotify and subscribe as long as freedom of speech is upheld and that everyone is allowed to speak their mind freely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Censorship. As long as Spotify respects freedom of speech and doesnt impart politics on my music and pod casts Ill be a happy customer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Skim personal info for no reason. To register they forced me to state my gender and my age, why?Im paying a subscription but its still full of adverts and spam, Spotify promoted music appears above my own likes / playlists etc. The user experience is rotten unless you care about using commercial playlists. Like you cant link from a track thats playing to the full album or directly to the artist, I just get pushed towards playlists. Google music is a lot better. Will go back to that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship?. SPOTIFY is censoring the awesome song The Patriot which is all about unifying the entire country, because why??? Since when is patriotism considered something to be censored? Oh yeah, yall must be owned by China NWO folks....sex violence and racism ok, but patriotism is your worst nightmare. We see you clearly. Thanks for revealing who owns you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Responsibility Matters. I just dumped the app as expression of displeasure with Spotifys tacit support of public health disinformation. Ive rotated between different streaming services over time & Spotify was fine in the past - fine means okay, not exceptional. And their current embrace of Joe Rogan is a bridge too far for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UPDATE FORCES NEW LOGIN METRICS . Have the Premium prescription. Spotify asking for more personal information and pressuring you into third-party data/personal mining (READ: Updated Personal Information, locale, etc.) ... WHY?Hot fix or role back latest update.Cancellation of this user, imminent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Broadcast the Truth. Your insistence on broadcasting scientifically false claims regarding COVID via the Joe Rogan podcasts is leading to more COVID-related deaths. I totally support the right to freedom of speech. However, Spotify must assume a role in assuring all the broadcasts it promulgates are accurate and scientifically sound. The people in this world need accurate information to make informed decisions. Placing disclaimers on program content is a bogus excuse and most listeners ignore them. Unfortunately, many listeners believe everything they hear. Spotify needs to take on the responsibility of ensuring their content is accurately broadcast. This isnt censorship; its broadcast responsibility. Please do the right thing. Dont pursue the money. I will not extend my Spotify subscription unless I see that Spotify assumes its social responsibility. I will truly miss this app.  Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep your politics out of my music. Spotify has been a great service, but the occasionally inserted political stuff is reminding me why its a good idea to own things that are yours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The platform of Fascism and Censorship. If you like to think for yourself this is not the app for you. Spotify is complying with state sponsored media blackouts. Get out and demand your money back #BoycottSpotify #CensorshipIsEvil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Mining. Ive had Spotify for years, until I cancelled and deleted the app because Apple kindly pointed out what personal information the Spotify App was stealing from me. Why do you want my browsing history?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stupid decisions by Spotify. Keep it up, keep silencing different opinions and see what happens to our society. So disappointed in the people running Spotify. I actually liked this app, but you couldnt just leave well enough alone. Well, I dont need this app any longer if theyre going to take political sides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy/ dont want others to connect to it. I wish there was a setting that would allow the account holder to control devices that connect to ur Spotify..like for say they have to put in a pin or confirm email/phone to connect other. Or even to keep it from showing publicly on WiFi etc. like a hidden setting maybe???? Im only giving 4 stars cause of this and if it had this then it would be 5 stars no doubt...other than that I have a premium account and love it more than pandora cause its truly  a lot nicer tbh. (I tried both in comparison) if Spotify comes out with this setting for say than that would be great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Promotes health misinformation. Spotify allows deadly Covid misinformation on their platform. I cannot support that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Could be perfect, inexplicable UI choices instead. A Spotify PR person would probably say theyre always innovating in response to the below. Its not true. Periodically breaking your product and fixing it is not growth or innovation. Its not innovative to suddenly stop an automobile operators  music to make them look at their phone to read a message saying not to look at their phone. That was not a smart move and wasnt a safety move, it was a PR move. Its also stupid to hide or fail to make obviously available a list of all the songs and albums a person has downloaded... I dont get how you can even spin this to make sense. What the hell is my Artists section? It doesnt contain all the artists I listen to or have downloaded from. Same with Albums section... this is so stupid. When a person DOES find their song, this app does deliver the sound through the speakers or headphones of your choice, usually (sometimes it decides to stop the music and make you look at your phone and press a button for permission to restart the song, but only when youre driving).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify blind to misinformation. Why does Spotify have to host garbage opinion content? Stick to music. My money wont support divisive crap, free speech or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disinformation Purveyors. Shame on you Spotify. Take responsibility for the content on your service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A bit pricey but worth the download. I have all that I need on Spotify in terms of listening to Podcasts and listening to Music all in one except theres no videos which is perfect for me because it allows me to take a break from using YouTube. Nothing against them mI love watching YouTube however, I found it to be a huge idol in my life so I wanted to have something that would have some podcasts I listen to from my favorite YouTubers and songs on there. Such as RuslanKD, Desiring God, GotQuestions.org, and etc. Which essentially killing two birds with one stone. The two things I believe Spotify could do better is make it easier to make payments on the all accessing the plans youve purchased as well as keeping track of what you spent on the app instead of going on their website to do it. Another thing that Spotify can improve on is if they could allow more options to personalize your profile more like with a Bio, Prompt, (Whats your favorite artist or song?) customize background picture, and etc. I thought that would be a fun touch to personalize your profile more like you can do on other platforms. One final thing I would like Spotify to also increase what you can do in your settings as for as security goes like Twi Factor Authorization for an example. In general it would be beneficial to me at least to have more security options to choose from to feel comfortable with having my account safety secured. Keeping track of whats going on and who is trying to get into my account. By the way havent had no problems, but thought I would write this out for future references. Hope everike has a wonderful day Spotifying anf God bless",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship Central. Cowering under fear of their authoritarian peer pressure, Spotify removes the only reason half the people downloaded their app in the first place. They actively suppress freedom of speech and I intellect conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Very sad that Spotify is censoring content and creators voices. Agree or disagree, people should have a voice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep freedom of speech. Keep everyone talking about whatever people want to talk about on Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify is irresponsible. This company is lower than dirt. They promote irresponsible journalist and endorse false info. This Voss lives, not just inconvenience. Cancel your account ASAP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reads your phone data. just so everyone knows, spotify must have access to all your music files. a lot of stuff i exclusively listened to on apple music has started to appear on my spotify curated playlists, it HEAVILY interferes with my listening experience. if i wanted to listen to what i was in 2014, i would have stayed with apple music. awful. just awful. might as well go back to apple at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"spotify needs to be held accountable for allowing disinformation. I've cancelled my premium and will no longer support this garbage company that puts profits over human lives, by allowing Joe Rogan to spread debunked and dangerous science to his audience.   I believe Spotify has a moral obligation to ensure that their artists aren't causing life threatening harm to their users.  At the very least Spotify should be banning Rogan for giving anyone any Covid related opinions and taking down all episodes when he talked about Covid conspiracy theory.   Am quite happy to vote with my wallet on this""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NO to CENSORSHIP. Im deleting my account because of Spotifys censorship. Mike B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First amendment rights. Spotify stands up for our first amendment rights Neil Young, Apple Music and Joni Mitchell are opposed to free speech and want to censor and cancel people. This is unAmerican. Thanks Spotify Free speech baby",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep it uncensored Yes yes. I already loved Spotify but what got me out of my way to review was finding out that they dont censor and let you just talk Keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep politics and music separate. There is no room in Spotify for political advertising. I have black lives matter and all kinds of unity and social justice crap plastered on my homepage. I paid for this app, this is BS that I have no control over what I see. You&#39;re advertising on an app that I pay monthly for so that I dont have to deal with this stuff. Remove it, give me the option to remove it, or Ill just cancel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As long as joe Rogan. Is allowed to stay on Spotify I WILL continue to pay for this service. The first amendment to the constitution protects freedom of speech - not the speech you like but the speech you do not like.  If it were the other way around we would have no need for this amendment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FREEDOM. Love the fact Spotify doesnt censor free speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Go woke go broke. Spotify has started censoring content and only puts out false information about numerous topics while censoring and labeling actual factual information and differing opinions. Not worth paying for it. Will get factual information elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unaware of malicious share groups. This app has a lot of options that can be a serious problem to your devices from people who take control your devices. And actually modify the Spotify intellectual property. This is insane to be not allowed to unsubscribe or delete the app off your device. I found that they use old apps to execute there control over your identity and the knowledge of certain personal info that you think would be safe. How are they using my device after it&#39;s deleted is not sharing , I wanna know who I&#39;m dealing with. I enjoy Spotify. It&#39;s pod casts look interesting. As u figured I haven&#39;t really used too much of Spotify, but will eventually learn more of it on my laptop , PC &amp; iPhone. Not too into the sharing things with total strangers. I seen that it must be enjoyable to meet ppl on Spotify. That&#39;s my feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy setting. It would be nice not to have to go to the privacy setting and turn it off every time listen to Spotify. Other than that I really like Spotify. Wish this was a one time setting until I chose to share my music taste with every one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify review. I love Spotify so much I just really wish you could use it without it taking your data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify stop with the politics. As a paid subscriber I should be entitled to commercial and political free listening. Get the Obamas off of the app or give users the ability to remove them  If I wanted politics content Id go to Fox News or CNN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify Does Not Care About Your Kids. Spotify will currently let you make a playlist for your pets. If your cat wants to listen to Josie And The Pussycats, your are in luck. However, if you have actual human children, Spotify doesnt seem to care too much. Spotify allows you to block explicit content. Thats great in theory but awful in execution. I currently have a song in my weekly, Spotify generated playlist called F@#k You. It is not blocked for being explicit. Why such a major fail on something so obvious?  Because Spotify makes no effort on their own to block any explicit content. According to the Spotify website, Spotify relies on the record companies to report their own songs as explicit. Thats right, the companies who make money by getting their songs as many plays as possible are also the ones who are supposed to report their songs as explicit which would prevent their songs from getting played. Seems like a conflict of interest. Spotify could easily create a program that scans lyrics and blocks offensive content. But,what would be even easier would be giving me control of what I listen to. For years Spotify had a button that let you block any song or artist that you wanted to block for any reason  that you wanted to. This was great. When a song came on that I didnt like or had explicit content, I could block it and never hear it again. I had control. Now, Spotify has removed the block button. Now I have little control. You have to have your device close by and manually skip a song every time it plays if you dont want to hear it.  So, Spotify makes no effort to block explicit content, relies on record companies to regulate their content even though they are financially motivated not to, and I no longer have any control over what I can block. Im paying for a premium subscription but Im getting a less than premium experience. Until Spotify re-adds the block button, they are proving they care more about my cat than my kid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I will not support a company that censors. People have a God given right to speak their minds without being censored. I just read that over a 100 of Joe Rogan interviews were deleted. Thats disgusting to me and a lot of other people that value freedom over thought police and tyranny. Let them have and inch and anyone they dont like will be delete So Im deleting Spotify and all my friends and family are canceling their subscriptions until Spotify reverses their egregious decision. Go woke go broke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False information. I can no longer stay with Spotify because they are allowing joe Rogen to continue to push his misinformation out on there platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. I know Spotify is in a tough position,  but there are times where companies need to stand up an do what is right.  I have never listened to Joe Rogan, however, I believe in the first amendment.  The government and big companies shouldnt be deciding what is defined as misinformation.  I am watching closely and am considering canceling my subscription.  Do the right thing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify promotes censorship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My Go-to app. I dont mind paying for what I love.  I want you to pass my two-cents on to the higher ups.  I am planning on getting the apple one subscription service, and I do use apple Music.  But only as an addendum to Spotify.  I love the way apple does their lyrics.  I love the access to the library.  Its the player that plays my personal music content.  However, Spotify has a much superior service and feel.  I love how a playlist will continuously play and I dont feel like I need to babysit the app to enjoy it.  I love the curated playlists Waay better than apples. The ease of accessing artist and album info is a feature I use often, and it is so clunky on apple that it takes all interest and enjoyment out of it and I go searching for the song on Spotify...  I do wish the apple TV Spotify experience was as fluid and effortless as it is on my phone.  What I dont like is that I cannot sign in once and expect it to remain signed in.  My spontaneous I want my Spotify now mood gets squished with the annoying log in request(I pay for premium family, add my tv to that family and keep it logged in)   And then once I log in... a feature we love is the queue.  Why cant I queue music on the tv interface?  So depending on my particular music mood, I have to leave my beloved playlist and trudge over to apple Music where I can queue up my vibe or the kids can add their choices.  I do like how on Apple TV music, once music is playing I can scroll up to the albums and run the cursor over the albums to pick the song I want next.  With tv Spotify Im stuck with the static button options.  Thats no fun. Anyway.  My point is... you are both valuable subscriptions and apple consolidating simply means that its more within my budget for my family but it will not change my listening habits because I prefer Spotify.   Focus your lawyer money on making your service the best ever.  Dont worry about what another company is doing.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship thru pressure from the left. Buh bye ending my Spotify account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unhappy that Spotify is hosting covid misinformation during the pandemic. I was unaware that Spotify doesnt have a policy similar to YouTube, or Twitter or Facebook etc that precludes covid misinformation from being published on its platform. Given you seem to prioritise revenue over public health, Im cancelling my subscription and moving to another music service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everyone should cancel Spotify. You are a racist, anti-democractic entity that should be ruined Our family and as many friends that I can contact will be told delete and end using this app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please dont make a political statement. Ok, so I open up the Spotify app and INSTANTLY get bombarded with nothing but BLM. Really Spotify? Yea, black lives matter. But guess what, ALL LIVES MATTER. Please stop spamming us with this stuff. I know you intended well with everything going on right now, but trust me, no one looks to Spotify to make a political statement. I come to Spotify for MUSIC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Still cant block followers? Spotify, you move had ample time to get this done since when it was first brought up. What the heck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I just downloaded the app in support of Joe Roegan. You (Spotify from and of Sweden)  should not censor people like Joe i think you should keep moving in the opposite censoring direction and you understand what i mean i mean Censoring like Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, hey i will pay my subscription after maybe a year without  paying spotify just in good faith that profits wont change you (By you i mean everyone who works at Spotify) again i am in support of Freedom Of Speaking Censorship is not freedom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify promotion of harmful misinformation. Canceling my premium account and deleting app. They are disgusting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not sure this is a secure service. Far too many attempts of hacking into my account....and no reassurance from Spotify when I reported this, very poor service and no urgency about this issue... will now look at cancelling my subscription and looking at alternatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont like family rules. The rules you have added for Spotify family is horrible and seems immensely unnecessary. If Spotify cant even pay the artists a decent and fair amount for their music, why does  Spotify feel justified in restricting the members in how and where they can use the service?  It seems like a horrible way to run the business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constitutional right. If, for any reason, you let Joe Rogans podcast go, I will never use Spotify ever again and will share that with everyone that I ever cross paths with. You should be ashamed and not give into someones constitutional right of free speech. Youve been warned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy. Ive been using Spotify premium for years now and if theres something I dont like about it, its the fact that we cant block people. I used to publish all of my playlists but now that my ex lover found my account and followed me, I deleted them. Its just really frustrating because you cant do nothing if someone doesnt want to unfollow you. I dont care if strangers listen to my playlists because I dont know them personally but when it comes to the people I know in real life... It just feels like I have no privacy. Ive been thinking about creating another account but it would be a waste of time to search for every single song Ive been listening to during the last years. It would be great if you could find a solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify app. Spotify would rather broadcast misinformation than broadcast correct information. Its all about keeping lies for cash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Props for free speech. Ive never been that interested in Spotify, but you have chosen to stand up for what true science represents and given a platform to well spoke. And highly qualified advocates of informed consent. I support companies which do this and there are a great many who are like me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify doesnt support free speech. Any company that doesnt support the bill of rights doesnt deserve to exist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. I love that Spotify isnt scared of free speech and doesnt treat the general public like children by trying to control what info we receive as opposed to all these other left leaning companies that act like fascists who are scared of free speech and think we are all too dumb and too impressionable to handle information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. My music is archived through Spotify Anyone in my immediate circle from friends to employees have to have Spotify to interact via music in anyway ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make censorship illegal. I love Spotify and all of your great music but if you for one second even contemplate getting rid of Joe Rogan Ill be gone like the wind and 50 million of your other customers peace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Premium and quarantine. We should get spotify premium for free at least until quarintine and social distancing is over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Great for streaming music, terrible for privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Protect Free Speech. When you start censoring people you lose me as a listener of your platform. Back up Rogan and support open discussion of ideas. I have deleted your app. Ill find my media elsewhere unless Spotify steps up and support freedom of speech. If you dont like Rogans show, dont listen to him. Bye Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete Spotify. Im deleting this app. You let someone tell you who we can listen to is censorship.  Goodbye Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I dont support miss information and hate. Spotify has let us down. Vote with you dollars and cancel you account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. We dont care what artist choose to leave your platform. I believe allowing free speech should remain Ill be listening more to Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify is too political, play the music and shut up. Spotify is getting raped for political purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misinformation. Spotify is allowing Joe Rogan to spread misinformation. Youre prioritizing money over safety. Shameful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech. I appreciate Spotify so much for allowing all voices to be heard. In my own family we disagree on politics and a variety of issues but I will always defend their right to free speech. I appreciate being able to listen to different viewpoints and always learn something new.Thank you for standing firm when so many are caving I am proud to subscribe to your service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasion of privacy. I would uninstall this app if there was a viable competitor. I want to listen to Spotify on my computer, but despite the app on my phone being closed they are invading my phones OS and forcibly changing the volume on my phone to match that of my computer.  This has me speechless, as best I can tell theres no way to turn this feature off, and I certainly didnt opt in. Truly a terrible customer experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overreachofyourauthority. I have been listening to Spotify for years now and found it a really good resource for music , stories and information it is only recently I have found myself thinking about leaving because of the censorship Spotify is now engaged in I noticed you hold artists that engage in fowl language and subjects but censoring others that deal with facts FREE SPEACH FOR ALL?  or just for fly babies? Ttt Only Spotify gets to decide?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leaving this platform. Spotify spreads misinformation. Im deleting my account. Free speech is different from deliberate lies that harm people. Good bye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disinformation. I will never listen to this app again. I'm deleting it now. If Spotify won't control disinformation this I will control what I listen to by not enabling corporations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Byeee. Never use Spotify and will be deleting the app since the admins have proven to censor conservatives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleting. Deleting the app today. I know Im a nobody and my one act wont change anything. But I cant support the dissemination of harmful rhetoric. When books ruled the day regarding access to knowledge we had built in checks and balances to make sure the information in a book was accurate, current, and honest. Encyclopedias could not lie to you. They could not have alternate definitions. Because they were FACT CHECKED, and were held to a standard. The internet knows no such filter. And Spotify is a medium that suggests followship deems credibility. They are not the same. I will not be part of supporting a company who doesnt regard truth with holy sanctity. Its a shame that artists are the first taking a stand, and not the platform demanding better from its content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joe Rohan Exp. Keep Spotify an open platform of information sharing. This is fundamental to freedom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Garbage App and Creators. Spotify may have hegemony over the music-listening industry, however this does not nullify the mediocrity of their creation. The apps crash rate is a perpetual flaw. I cant listen to one bloody song without it crashing. The ads are horrendous and Spotify shoves down each users throat a radical political agenda that fits its own capitalistic whims. I downloaded the app for Joe Rogan, though it seems Joe has no idea what he got himself into. The ads during music-listening are rife with homosexual and female wiles that I have no bloody idea what they are getting at. In fact, I think theyre trying to curate their audience by alienating average folk to the point of a dumbed-down complicit female-abiding community. Ive noticed mass censorship on this application as well. Politic in the EU and US are bad, but politic on Spotify are worse. I do not care for homosexual laws in Japan, Spotify, nor do I care about spousal abuse, so take your ads and shove it. If you think you are going to force to purchase premium m, please think once more. Id rather endorse a smaller, less pervasive music app that will someday rival your antics with ingenuity and impartiality on the daily. Look up Spotifys microphone patentits orwellian, to say the least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They share to much of your information. Spotify shares too much of your information and they also quash any type of music that doesnt fit what they want never ever pay for service through this company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is the FUTURE. Update 12-Aug-20:Just got the All Filled Up Spotify message which has capped my saving library. News articles state Spotify removed the cap but I am still getting this error in Canada. What a sneaky way Spotify. Spotify is very sneaky and I dont know if I can trust them fully seeing how they secretly have these limitations and how they remove features like the tap and slide preview feature many years ago which was utilizing their servers too much. Spotify please fix this issue Im also a share holder but probably not for long.Spotify&#39;s service is unmatched. I have tried other cloud based music services but nothing got me hooked like Spotify. They even have a Spotify pc application and it lets u skip songs and skim through. Spotify web is available for people who cannot install applications (work).How can we invest in Spotify Ltd. ?If Spotify keeps updating the app and service then we got a winner here . Once everyone has an unlimited data service on their phone (predicting 2016/2017) then it will be a no brainer to use cloud music.(Update: 04-Jan-19)Spotify and waze integration not working all the time on iPhone XS MAX. Keeps opening in Spotify app and then nothing shows up on the waze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I deleted my account. Spotify refuses to stop the toxic spread of misinformation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will be leaving Spotify (like they care) because obviously they have caved to wokeness in America and allowed our WH to strong arm them into suppressing first Amendment rights.  I will not support any organization that does not support America and our constitution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify Is Now Censoring Free Speech. There are PLENTY of other ways to listen to music. Spotify is no longer one I will be using.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supporting the spread of misinformation. Wont be using Spotify to stream music for their aiding the spread of misinformation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok. I wish there werent so many limitations on my phone Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible design for users. Spotify keeps pushing unwanted displays to even their premium users with no ability for preferences or modification of what music and shows are thrust all over your home screen. For the ridiculous amount of data tracking Spotify has on its users, you think they would at least let them customize what their home screen shows them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best. Spotify protects it freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify. Thank you for allowing more than one opinion, do not censor people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is too restrictive. Spotify is way too strict for users who arent willing to pay or are not able to pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify = censorship. F these puds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goodbye Spotify. If you too are going to censor people then I will have nothing to do with you. Deleting all traces of Spotify from my life. Its not up to Spotify to decide what listeners can choose from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free speech. I enjoy the free speech that the Spotify platform provides, by defending this fundamental freedom, it encourages deep thought and debate, which leads to the best outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Access with downsides. Spotify is amazing at giving access to music youd never otherwise have access to but it will constantly be seeking to pigeon hole your tastes and as a result actually makes it harder to find new stuff the algorithm wouldnt otherwise guess youd like.  Its makes the world bigger and then actively tries to make your world smaller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your Disrespect of Black People. As a black person I can no longer use Spotify after the Joe Rogan situation and your continued support of him. Him using the n word 200 times and calling a black neighborhood the real planet of the apes. You and him are disgusting. The lowest form of human. I will be canceling my account and deleting this wretched app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Protect accounts more. So My account has been taken over and I just barely noticed today, I changed my password and also for my email but why couldnt Spotify notify the location where my account was used if it was out of the ordinary right ? And also I keep trying to listen to music and it keeps pausing and going back to the songs the hackers were listening to on my account. I feel violated that my account is being used by garbage people And Spotify needs to protect peoples account more serious like us paying customers ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify is curating content it disagrees with.  Do not subscribe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont want the politics. Ive payed for Spotify for years, and love it. I pay to remove ads. Im disappointed that Spotify has displayed what is tantamount to an advertisement for black lives matter right at the top of my home screen. Contacting support they will tell you they are using their platform to amplify black voices, but I dont care. Do this to free users if you want, thats your right, but when I give you money to remove ads then I dont even want to see ads from Spotify itself. This isnt Facebook or twitter, I dont want Spotifys opinions or activism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If only this platform didnt support racists who spread misinformation. Spotify should know better. Freedom of speech doesnt mean freedom from consequences from what they say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Access blocked. Access to my app is blocked by Spotifys choose tracking pop up. You can either choose tracking or not have access to your account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#delete Spotify. I will support platforms that do not harm their customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Music App or Political Vehicle for Idiots. Im not supporting an alleged Music app that supports such a dangerous individual intent on peddling fake news or misinformation that might put anyone at risk. All Spotify apps binned. Cancel culture are us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Product Review. As I started listening to music, I wanted an app that allowed me to still listen to music even when I closed the app. That's when I started using Pandora, but it was not the right fit. I tried navigating through Apple Music but I got confused most of the time. Which led me to try Spotify. I immediately fell in love with the app. Spotify is a streaming service meant to produce and listen to your favorite music and a place to store it all. The main strengths of Spotify are its clear app navigation, high-quality playback, and personalized music collection. It also allows you to offload the music so you can listen without any signal/data. When you open the app, everything is laid out for you. You can easily access all your favorite music playlists, look at settings, search for any song/artist, etc. This is important because many other apps make you question where any of the features are. Spotify has high-quality playback. When you listen to a song, it produces the highest quality. It does not sound muffled or frozen. Spotify allows for a personalized music collection. For instance, it creates daily mixes based on your music history. Every year, Spotify gives you your top songs followed by what year. This is one of my favorite features about Spotify because it gives you a nostalgic feeling when you rediscover your music. When you have premium it allows you to download your music offline, which allows you to enjoy your music without any internet connection/data. I personally love Spotify for this feature because it allows me to listen to music when I am on a plane or on road trips. The main weaknesses of the product are the bug fixes that make the app freeze, competition within streaming services, and its technical issues. For instance, Spotify recently had a big issue when it came to opening the app. From a personal standpoint, when I opened the app, it logged me out of my account. When I tried signing in again, the app told me there was an error. This created a sense of panic for me because all my music comes from that app. Although, this issue got resolved. Most of society uses Apple Music and other streaming services which makes for a competition against Spotify. Most people prefer the other services because they believe Spotify is not a good fit for them making it difficult for Spotify to gain users. Spotify is known to have technical issues. Speaking from personal experience, one time I tried playing a song but the song froze. I opened the app again to see if it was a glitch but it still was the same result. Although this issue was also resolved. Overall, I still prefer Spotify as my streaming service for music. Because of its high-quality music playback, personalized music collection, and the ability to download music offline, it has helped make music more enjoyable. I have been using Spotify for 6 years now, I know that app inside and out. I love how personal that app is because it gathers all your music history and makes personalized playlists for you to enjoy. I encourage all of my friends to use Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only because of Joe Rogan. Only because of Joe Rogan am I downloading Spotify. If he is removed or censored myself and many others will have no use for Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Spotify stands up against censorship. I appreciate platforms that allow you to hear different POV and make your own decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It needs a blocking feature. I use this app everyday and I love it, however, I wish Spotify would implement the ability to remove/block people who follow your account. When blocked that person would automatically unfollow you and unable to see your playlists/listening activity. Perhaps even unable to search for your account after blocked as well.Users should have privacy if they wish and control over who sees their activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just restrictions. I have used many different platforms for Spotify. None have been nearly as restricted as on my phone. I have unlimited skips and free control over what song I listen to on my computer with only the inconvenience of an add or two every so often. All without premium. Its the same way on PlayStation too. However, the phones have heavy restrictions on free users. Thats my only complaint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uses cellular data even when switched off. Writing this on 05/04/2021. As of the most recent app update, Spotify uses data even when the option is disabled in settings under cellular data. This is extremely frustrating and makes me want to cancel my subscription and delete the app entirely. I dont understand how it is even possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D茅sinformation = Spotify. Unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Discrimination. How is it in the year 2020, Spotify is allowed to discriminate? Why isnt Spotify available in predominantly black countries? While Apple Music is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Spotify BUT. To the company as a whole: cut your ties with Peter Thiel. The price of using your app shouldnt be my rights and LIFE. Im considering no longer using Spotify and encouraging everyone I know to do the same. I dont want my money to go to organizations and politicians that fight to take away my rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every country to access. Why cant every country get access to Spotify why cant you make improvements on that,because of that limitation people are missing out alot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, no tyrannical censorship. I think. As far as I can tell, Spotify doesnt censor the other side. I havent used it much, but it seems to be a free place. Its not very intuitive, by way of searching, scrolling through the home feed to randomly select a video, etc. but all in all I like it so far",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Really interesting that Spotify employees are trying to censor Joe Rogan. Spotify = anti 1st amendment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete Spotify. Allowing the spread of lies and misinformation. Delete Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship is wrong, and Spotify did the right thing. Latest news from Spotify proves that they support free speech. One does not have to agree with the speech while supporting this key right of every American.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leftists removing content. We can make up our own minds We dont need Spotify to protect us from misinformationSPOTIFY IS CENSORING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A cynical move by a greedy company. First, your service is not as easy to use as others, like Tidal. Second, you thought it was a good idea to pay a misinformed dude bro millions to spout his disinformation on your service. Well count me out. Ill never use Spotify again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship now unfortunately makes this app useless. Ive been a Spotify user since day 1, but will no longer pay for a service that has rendered half of every playlists worthless by censoring songs without request by the user. Labeling of explicit content is often faulty, and going back to search through thousands of songs to try and replace edited with unedited versions is just ridiculous. Spotify really messed this up bigtime.. no solutions offered at all. Look for another service. Id imagine apple is leaps ahead at this stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censored. My family and I have enjoyed Spotify for several years and I have recommended it to others. Music is expression. Sometimes its good, sometimes its downright scary. The point is that its rarely censored. People get to CHOOSE their music every bit as much as they should be able to CHOOSE their podcast. We as humans have had and always will have differing opinions. It is what helps us solve problems and create great things because we all think differently. To censor Joe Rogan or anyone will be the same thing as saying not everyones music can be played. Neither I nor my family will be supporting Spotify if this happens. I stand for freedom of speech and expression as well as freedom of ideas and thoughts. This country was founded on that. To let a few has been singers who once probably fought for freedom change that for EVERYONE IS INSANE. There are way more like me than there are like them. If Spotify starts down this road If will face GREAT OPPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disappointed. Recent news that Spotify allows dangerous content. While many of us sit at home fretting over this pandemic and experiencing the affects of Covid, others preach dangerous misinformation and Spotify allows it. You are responsible for your content and the impact it has on the listeners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disappointed. I would just prefer if Spotify monitored the content they were broadcasting to verify if the information was valid.  Hopefully going forward they will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Dear spotify. If you censor Joe Rogan, I cancel my subscription. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beware: does not respect iPhone mobile data or push message settings. Spotify will consume mobile data and send push messages even if they have been disabled in the iPhone system settings. Even worse, while mobile data and push messages can be disabled via additional settings hidden within the app, updates can silently re-enable them. This behavior should not be allowed. Users have complained about this for nearly two years now and Spotify has no response. If you are a premium subscriber and want to download your music on wifi to avoid excessive mobile data charges, you will need to monitor the app to check it has not resumed using your data. I have been charged for excess data usage several times now, each time because Spotify had silently ignored my preferences and resumed mobile data usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal data. The service is good- I just dont appreciate the terms of service- unfortunately Im not aware of other solid options in which my data isnt used for their benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data hog when not being used. My listening habits have changed I havent used Spotify in over a year. I started running into problems using up my data allowance on my cellular plan on a new phone, and it was largely due to Spotify. And I dont even use the app.  So be careful with data usage if that is important to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify rules. Spotify rules,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love Spotify. Please keep a free speech stance. I dont need corporate media outlets spoon feeding me what they think I should believe. I want to hear all sides of an argument and make my own informed decision without corporate bias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They might ban you next. Spotify now might ban you if your network has an ad blocker or content filter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only issue is security. Id hope Spotify adds a two factor authentication soon, but besides this, works well and worth it in my opinion. Security though, big issue that I hope they take seriously, adding another protective layer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Public behavioural data. I wish this app provided just the service of music streaming without making it a social media platform. I dont want followers or people being able to track what a listen to. I literally dont see why this option isnt available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deceptive practices. Spotify will not let me permanently delete my account without contacting customer service. In the internet are? Ugly business model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misinformation correction. Spotify is a platform that makes no attempt at moderating its content, allowing psuedoscience and misinformation to be used on important issues that affect public health and public safety. Shameful to see no attempt to curb this issue in todays age of disinformation and misinformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love Spotify but not the political bias. Why is my home screen populated with micheal and Obama storytelling and why cant I disable/remove it? This isnt what I signed up for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love. people who dont have spotify should not be allowed in polite society.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of Thought and Speech. In general I enjoy my Spotify subscription for a nice music selection and easy access to podcasts.  However, I am growing concerned that Spotify may take that turn towards authoritarian thought and speech control.  Spotify is bending to the radical thought police in its handling of the Joe Rogan issue.  Luckily they have not removed him completely, but they have removed certain past episodes of his podcast in an attempt to appease the radical authoritarians.Im not particularly a fan of his, but I have listened to several of his podcasts where he has allowed marginalized thought to be heard, i.e. Dr. McCullough and Dr. Malone.  He asked good pressing questions and allowed these Drs the chance to be heard.In these Orwellian days, where governments and the media have taken the role of determining what truth is, by suppressing and not debating different viewpoints, our society suffers greatly.  For how can the citizenry determine what is truthful when we are dictated to.  That is the hallmarks of totalitarianism.Spotify should stand up for the free exchange of ideas, to allow for free speech and expression.  If Spotify continues down an authoritarian path of canceling someone like Joe Rogan, I will cancel my subscription and never use the service again.Spotify, please be moral and ethical and stand up to the egalitarian cancel culture.  Stand up for we common people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Josh. You keep kicking me out of my premium account. The rest of my family that I pay for can use it except me. You dont have a phone number to talk to anyone anymore, only email. Ive had more trouble with Spotify in the last 6 years than Obama did with North Korea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Locked out of account. Spotify locked me out of my account for an hour or two. I was afraid my data mightve been hacked or password stolen. Watch out for your data privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I dont care for Spotify. I dont appreciate when people use racial slurs and them not being removed from Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racist political propaganda. Its been brought to my attention that Spotify has become a political agenda. It saddens me that companies like this put their own personal views before the freedoms of their customers. Canceling shows because it does not align with the companies political views is a hit on our freedom of speech. Better come out publicly and denounce your political attack on its customers or you will loose .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify and to whom it may concern. This app is alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. Thinking about getting rid of my Spotify premium in a month if they keep censoring Joe Rogan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why do you think you have the right to censor?. I quite liked the app until they decided to be like Facebook and Twitter and decide what content we can and cant listen to. Sorry Spotify, you have now shown your true colours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Warning Fraudulent Advertising. Spotify premium markets itself as an ad-free service. However premium users are served endless pop-up ads that not only interrupt music but also disable users from accessing their interface. Even with all notifications disabled, paid users still get pop ups.There are countless public support requests complaining about this issue and Spotify staff dishonesty gaslights users, instructing them to carry out meaninglessness tasks (e.g. reinstall the app) that obviously wont stop a huge corporation from lying and screwing their users simply because they can.You shouldnt download this app and support a company like Spotify but you will. Youre a consumer and you will do what youre told.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage. The people who work at Spotify are unbelievable. Why would you add a little white pop up box that tells people what device they are connected to with change next to it. Its completely pointless. If people cant figure out what device they are connected to then thats on them. The next thing that makes absolutely no sense to have in the app is the big white pop up saying added to queue. Its literally the most pointless thing in an app full of pointless things. I know the song has been added to the queue when the page that I can add the song to the queue goes away. I dont need a pop up tell me something I already know. And the last thing I cant believe someone at Spotify thought was a good idea is when you hit the 3 dots on a song the page bounces. Like just why? I just dont understand can anybody tell me how that makes the app better in anyway. If these changes arent made soon Im going to cancel my subscription. The people at Spotify consistently make completely useless changes to the app for the sake of making changes and Im done with it. While Im telling you people how to do your job Ill tell you one more thing that needs to be done. Because every phone made now has an OLED you need to have the option to have an OLED dark mode. Im going to assume you dont know what that means so Ill tell you. The current back ground color is grey. But for phones that have an OLED display(literally every phone made in the last 2 years) any part of the screen that is black it means those pixels arent on so it saves battery. So in other words change the background of the app from grey to black.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Activists. Spotify employs activists that want - demand - to censor Joe Rogan because it doesnt conform to their odd LGBTQ1234 dangerous SJW demands. Odd. Since these people have obvious mental health issues and demand to force this minority way of life into PAYING subscribers. If this stands, Ill cancel my accounts. As others will too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Getting Political. Spotify is jumping on the bandwagon of trying to indoctrinate their listeners by promoting black and pride music channels, etc. Stop pushing your political agenda. Just let people listen to music in peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great App, but...third party access needs fixin. i have spotify premium so i dont have any complaints about ads. my frustration comes from the lack of genuine shuffling, and also another big issue. ive always used a 3rd party app to be able to switch my Spotify playlists to apple music and so forth, but Spotify just revoked this ability while i could understand if other music providers made the same move, but it sounds like Spotify is just trying to find a way to keep people on Spotify. (i have both Apple Music &amp; Spotify, which is why this is frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app gave me aids. Spotify shouldnt exist and the people who made this pile of steaming garbage should be executed for crimes against humanity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont trust you guys. i got a pop up basically saying can i see your personal data and info for ads and i said no and half way through a song i got an ad about protecting my data from companies trying to steal it lol you play too muchbtw you took a great song app and destroyed it with ads just like soundcloud im just waiting for the day that leaving to app while playing music is a month subscription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great App, Shrewd Business. I love Spotify, always have. Their premium service is great, but I think its a little shrewd that they disable the majority of features that make Spotify Spotify for mobile users unless they have premium. I think its unfair - because unless you have premium, theres nothing to distinguish it from Pandora (in fact I think at that point Id rather have Pandora, it at least has decent suggestions). I also hate that some albums, while still accessible through certain avenues, have been posted but are unable to be played. The content is all there - but the users just cant enjoy it. I realize that there are some privacy concerns with it, and that artists are free to post and take down what they want, but I think it just  inhibits the artists and takes away from the diversity of the platform. If the mobile app werent so neutered without premium, Id give this app 5 stars. But again - I understand why Spotify did it. People are on their phones more, phones are more convenient than computers to carry around and listen to music. They know that nowadays people will rush to pay for convenience, and theyre using that truth to get more money out of their customers. Very shrewd, but I respect it. I would give my fellow viewers a run down of the app, but lets be honest - we all know what Spotify is at this point. If youre reading the reviews, youre probably not reading them to figure out what Spotify is - you want to know the dirt about it. I can tell you only that unless you already have premium (which you can only buy online via a computer or web browser) youll be incredibly disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censoring Joe Rogan. Spotify, thanks for getting involved in media and deciding you know best what should be censored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify wants to censor, Im done. Spotify is the next app that Im deleting. If you believe in free speech, delete this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify. Spotify gives many options to listen to I really like it it doesnt use data thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify Slanders Their Own Creators Using Nebulous and Misleading Warnings. Spotify is embracing censorship of those with views that contradict government narratives. This includes experts in their respective fields. Worse, their warnings are left open ended and nebulous but lead of with extreme and very fringe examples of what is unacceptable. These warnings are then placed on videos that hold moderate dissenting views so that Spotify can insinuate the speaker is a conspiracy theorist or otherwise an unreliable source. For an example, go look at the warning on Joe Rogans podcast with Dr. Robert Malone (at worst one of the key contributors to discovering mRNA vaccine applications and technology, at best the founder of said technology). Read the warning then watch the podcast from start to finish and see if you find the warning to be reasonable. Destroying the ability to discuss a variety of different solutions to a problem will only ensure the problem remains unsolved. Spotify and every other tech site engaging in such Orwellian behaviour must be held accountable for these actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let us block people. please give us the option to block people on spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship Policy. They have clearly demonstrated as a company that they have no consistent princples when upholding their platform. They act out of fear of mobs made of bullies who only seek their own utopian vision of what views can be accepted culturally and which views cannot. Spotify shares the view AND approach of these bullies; refusing to provide refuge to all viewpoints because they have no conviction to give it. As many corporations, they fail to represent the idea of a free and open society. I hope companies like Coinbase (which have real conviction) get into the music business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rubbish. You will get hacked and Spotify will do nothing about it. Theyre support team are useless and do not care about you or youre account. Do not buy Spotify premium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stay strong - free speech is essential. Spotify is a great product, no question. But they now have an even more loyal user for not bending to the will of a musician (whose music is great) that wants to promote censorship.  Granted, there are limits. One cant yell fire in a crowded theater.  But we need to promote the idea that individuals can have a difference of opinion.  If you dont like what is being said then share your own opinion.  I, and many others, want to listen to it as well.  That is freedom of speech.  It drives healthy debate and sways people on the fence.  It is also an act of freedom to take your music elsewhere. But this is one fan who wont follow.  Spotify is #1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify reply. Love the service     Just dont destroy it by getting political,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify you have a responsibility as a media provider. Stop enabling the spread of misinformation about covid vaccines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. It is up to the viewer to distinguish their truth.If we continue to censor and censor what will we have left? Everyone who thinks or talks the same. Pretty disturbing Spotify would go this low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corona Comfort. Spotify is an app to keep you company while this terrible situation everyone is in unfolds. Stay Safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corporate tyranny. Spotify is removing episodes and employees demanding editorial oversight over podcasts. They allow this censorship while rappers are allowed any language they want on killing police etc. Stop injecting political leanings of your employees into your business. Weve had enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify review. I really like the fact I get my own privacy and I have the control. Theres no interruptions or advertising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free Users Dont Have Rights. As the title says, if you plan on using Spotify with a free plan, youll be very frustrated. Free users are forced to shuffle their playlists, can only skip 6 times per hour, and cant play single songs when searching for them. The funny thing is, all of these issues go away when you buy premium. Spotify treats free users terribly, and thats why Im switching to SoundCloud. If they cant treat free users correctly, then they dont deserve my money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Algorithms vs humanity. Spotify is going the route of Facebook and plans to decide what you want to listen to based on their algorithms. Now when you click on My Library you have a mess of songs, podcast, playlists and artists. Of course this was put in place to keep you on the app longer instead of easily accessing the music you want to. Before you had an organized space customized by you, but that makes too much sense so they had to remove it.This is reminiscent of Facebook removing chronological order and putting in place a system that decides what you see. Its 2021 and we see what damage that has caused. Highly disappointed in Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let us block people. Im not the only person who has gone through this, but my ex started following me on my spotify and its creepy. He has been cyber harassing me and all my friends and now he found his way to my spotify. I have spotify premium and i find it ridiculous that even though i pay for a good streaming service, the safety and protection is not good at all. the only thing i can do is make my playlists private, but it still doesnt stop him from following me or being able to share my profile. I have heard many people ask for this before and it still hasnt been done. Spotify, let us remove and block people, were not asking for much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doing whats right. Kudos to the CEO for not caving in and keeping our freedom of speech sacred to all even those who dont agree I will continue to listen to Spotify and recommend it to others. I dont always agree with what other people think but I would never try to suppress their freedom of speech because that is their belief,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Propaganda. I just deleted the Spotify app because of their careless facilitation of Joe Rogans dangerous propaganda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Needs a Spotify for education. I teach a rock history course, and I love all that Spotify offers I am a premium member. Many of my students (ages 12-14) openly admit they use Spotify on their personal devices at home. Our school will not allow Spotify to be used on school devices, due to terms of service, even with parent consent. The issue the district has in the data mining and student privacy issue. If Spotify were to offer a subscription, even with a site fee, that protected minors from these issues. It would be very resourceful in education. I have heard there has been litigation elsewhere in regards to apps being available in schools that have similar terms of service.I am wishing Spotify could do something like this so students can learn more about music and history",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Spotify censors contributors. Choose other apps that dont screw content creators to appease a mob.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disinformation Spreader. I will no longer use Spotify given their support of Joe Rohan and his disgusting misinformation campaign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great except. So now they are trying to tell me what music I can listen to My choice of music is not up for political debate  if I enjoy something they dont agree with it none of Spotifys business I havent used this app for a couple months, & l am looking at all the other options I Loved this app. They just needed to figure out theyre advertising. I dont mind the commercials just one at a time, & dont make me have to wait threw 2 minutes of would you like 30 minutes without commercials, & then 20 seconds after I watch a commercial Just get it over with So now that they are running commercials, they turn the volume on them to 10 Lately if I find a playlist Im interested in, I cant look threw it, I have to just listen to it ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete Spotify. They endorse medical misinformation that gets people killed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. The only benefit of Spotify was lack of censorship and providing a platform for open dialogue. That seems to have disintegrated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify supports racists. Shut down the racists and I will come back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I actually got dumber using when using Spotify. Spotify is not an American company, and is usung political  conten to influence American politics.  Dont trust.  There are better services (apple. Amazon, tidal, )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech. Glad that Spotify is supporting the First Amendment by allowing either side of the debate to speak freely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify loves censorship. Spotify lives telling artists what they can and cannot create. I feel sick to my stomach every time i use this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPOTIFY RULES. Better than Apple Music or Amazon Music. Period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two words: chart manipulation. Wish I could give it 0 stars. Spotify has always been suspicious about the way they operate when it comes to streams. However, its become very clear that there is something behind the scenes that the users are not aware of. If I pay for my monthly subscription, shouldnt my streams be counted? What is the point of listening and interacting with the app if youre gonna think Im less than a human being? Spotify allows certain artists to give out free Spotify premium accounts to stream their new singles while they cut out streams for other artists. Its very clear which industry plant theyre pushing next. As a consumer, I demand answers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHY???. I need premium to control my Spotify on my PlayStation4 from my phone now?? What is this nonsense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify supports misinformation. Im all for free speech, but spreading misinformation is something completely different. Its dangerous and its sad that Spotify allows this sort of misinformation to be made accessible by millions of people. Shame on Spotify. They need to do better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this fraud and saturation with commercials. I had Spotify supreme that turned into what appears to be an intentional theft of premium fees and forcing me to take their crappy ususal while charging me for paying. I had given up on the feds but I can think how state regulators can bring this either grossly  incompetent theft of money for free services.  Every day you ignore me like you are just a robot you  seem to accumulate the air of crime that blows out of Washington.  In short your obligation to provide the service you are charging for.  Has forced me to tolerate the WORST program I have ever seen.  As a trial lawyer my next complaint will be public and to regulators.  Your premium is excellent.  Free is torture to live with after awhile and probably actionable. Ill have to tell your competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"So many issues on Spotify. **update for today: Thanks for finally fixing three out of the four technical issues I mentioned. I dont know why it took nine or ten days to do it, but I appreciate the fact that my voice is being heard. Now I can go back to listening to my music the way how I like it. I will change it back to a four-star rating. The only way I will give Spotify a perfect five-star rating is if they fix the issue of letting me mute more than 100 artists like I mentioned.** I really like Spotify so much. In fact I use it so much more than Tidal, thanks to the dont play music from this artist feature. I now feel comfortable and happy that I can play the music I want without and music I dont want shoved down my throat. I would give Spotify a four-star rating. However, Im having a lot more issues on Spotify Ive been dealing with for the past few weeks that needs to be taken care of right away. Its preventing me from give this app four or five stars because thats how much these technical issues bother me. 1) Normally when I go to an artists profile, I would always go to their albums, check out their top songs and the list of the songs on their albums, play the sample that lasts a few seconds, and then like their songs that gets added to my liked songs part of my profile. However, today and yesterday I go to an artists page to check out their top songs and their albums, and every time I press the track listing just to see the list of the songs, nothing is coming up Its not letting me see the list of the songs at all How am I supposed to press the like button on the songs if youre not going to let me see the songs in the first place? This technical problem needs to be fixed right away or Im afraid Im not going to be able to check out any artists songs or albums (especially their new albums). 2) Normally whenever they say that Ill have thirty minutes of ad-free music, I usually do. However, for the past few days I have this issue when they say Ill get thirty minutes of ad-free music, they play three ads in a row. Then after playing two songs, they play four MORE ads right after that Whats up with that? Why announce that Ill get thirty minutes of no ads and yet play this much ads anyways? This needs to be fixed immediately When you say youll play thirty minutes of ad-free, just do so Dont play that many ads. 3) I listen to a lot of Persian music. Its one of my top five most favorite genres, along with pop, R&amp;B/soul, hip hop, and Latin (lots of Spanish music). With that being said, I notice that out of all the genres I saw on Spotify, they dont have one genre for Persian music only. They have Afro, Arab, Desi, K-Pop, and Regional Mexican music. But no Persian. Even more weird is that every time I listen to Persian music, I get more recommendations for Arabic songs and playlists instead of Persian ones. I dont understand why. Why are you recommending ARABIC songs after I listen to a lot of PERSIAN songs? Dont get me wrong I like Arabic music, but I dont appreciate Spotify recommending songs and playlists from the WRONG genre and the WRONG language. Thats like recommending Spanish songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Portuguese music, or recommending Chinese songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Korean music. Thats NOT OK. So what needs to be done right away is: a) create another genre specifically for Persian music only, and b) recommend songs and playlists for the CORRECT language and CORRECT genres; in other words, when I say I want Persian music, I want PERSIAN music, NOT Arabic music. PERSIAN music. PERSIAN songs, albums, and playlists from PERSIAN artists. 4) Like I mentioned before I really like appreciate Spotify for giving us the dont play music from this artist option. However the only problem is that were only limited to choose 99 artists. Once I reached to the 100th artist, all the artists I muted before now all of a sudden appeared on my homepage and all the playlists recommended to me. Why is that? I thought I have a right to play music from whichever artists I want and block music from artists I dont want. Why am I limited to mute 99 artists? Why cant I mute more than that without having any of them shoved down my throat on my homepage? I want to be able to mute more than 100 artists I dont care for and dont support from my homepage. Its MY profile and MY listening choice. I have the right to mute as many artists as I want, just like I have the right to follow as many artists as I want. Please fix this issue immediately. Once these changes are made, I will change my rating from three stars to five stars immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joe. Spotify allow there people to make racial comments and jokes and they are still allow to continue on the app ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for supporting free speech. Im glad Spotify has the ability to keep shows on and show support for free speech. If they change this policy Ill change my review to 1 star as they would be limiting those rights and stop using the app. In fact I only started using Spotify to listen to Joe Rogan and found out how great it is for other podcasts I listen to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Removing the app. I just removed Spotify because I do not want to run across misinformation on COVID-19 through voices such as Joe Rogan. Frankly, I can listen to my favorite music on platforms that do not include those voices and that is what I prefer.One more thing I dislike about Spotify now that Ive read more about its privacy rating is its intent to gather non-public, private information on its users. For having downloaded this app without paying attention to that bit, I blame myself. Lesson learned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Careful. They tell you right up front they track you. And since they fully support misinformation chances are youre already screwed. Hopefully you can get in on a class action lawsuit eventuallyAlso Spotify, FYI, free speech is NOT protected when spreading misinformation. Its in the Constitution and has been upheld by the Supreme Court(Gaertz v Welch Inc. (1974)). Dont yall have lawyers that know this stuff???",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App uses cellular data without permission. I switched off cellular data from Spotify in my phone settings, and yet Spotify uses it to sync music very often. Help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Protect Free Speech. I downloaded Spotify solely to hear Joe Rogans supposedly controversial episodes and found nothing to be offensive or coercive.  In fact, I see that the facts have been manipulated in the media.  I will continue to use this platform as long as they continue protecting free speech & allow Americans access to all opinions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social conscious. I have stopped using Spotify as it is in conflict with my values of social responsibility and critical evaluation of science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Improve security and privacy. i love spotify and it has always been my main music stream platform, but the security needs to be more secured to prevent hackers from getting into other peoples accounts. my premium account was hacked and someone was just hijacking my profile to listen to their own music. i wasnt even notified that someone had signed into my account using a different device please do enhance the security",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is racist. The app is racist. Or the people who run it are. They literally do exactly what white people do in the real world suppress black voices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stand with science not misinformation. I can no longer support Spotify due to their cavalier attitude about allowing dangerous misinformation to be on their platform. Deleted my account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify has Privacy Issues. They keep placing trash artists within my library without my permission.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racist owner. The owner of Spotify is a racist. I am canceling my subscription.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To non Spotify users. What are you doing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop censoring content. Spotify has disappointed me today. Im done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring is garbage. Spotify censors my content.  They throttled down Lil Wayne to almost unsearchable just after he endorses trump.  They took the audio off Alex Jones joe Rogan pod cast.  Im ending my subscription and how to hate this company for being part of the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Illegal on Spotify. Ha Im only 11 nice age security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible. Wish I never started using Spotify. I support freedom of speech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Public Safety. Im leaving Spotify and moving to Apple Music.  Question for Spotify - Will your conscience bother you knowing more and more Americans dont receive proper medical care thanks to your siding with the batsh&$ crazy Joe Rogan?  Hope the $150 million is worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good app, far too political. Ive used Spotify for many years and Ive just had to cancel my subscription. On your home screen, you are forced to look at podcasts and playlists of politically charged media. I listen to music to escape from this world, not to be reminded of it. It is very unfortunate that Spotify never listens to their upset customers. It should be an option to turn off seeing political media, especially because we are paying a monthly fee. Spotify is very disappointing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech is important. I support the free speech in spotify but the app is very buggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leave me alone. Spotify pushed political content on us without a way to opt out. No thanks. #MichelleOPodcast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politics. I am so happy that Spotify stayed out of the politics and provides a format on which people can share their honest opinions and scientific knowledge without fear of being canceled because of unfair social pressure. Actors and others cannot be permitted to force their judgment on anyone else and deprive reasonable thinkers with the opportunity to hear those voices. Thank you, Spotify",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great But. Love Spotify to bad they know what you should and shouldn&#39;t be listening to. First it&#39;s pod cast what&#39;s next music censor ship maybe they will remove all the explicit music content one of there employees finds offensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censoring Music. Spotify has taken it upon themselves to censor older music, while leaving degrading and derogatory from popular modern artists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very insecure. 3rd time random people have joint my family plan. Slight shocking how they get in... Also Spotify doesnt employ best practices like 2FA. Sad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SHOULD BE A BLOCK OPTION. I love Spotify and use it daily but I have an ex who stalks my playlists constantly and its super invasive. I would like to keep my playlists public but also be able to block certain people from being able to see my stuff as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfair. I find it unfair that some countries are not allowed to be registered to Spotify because of where they live,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont censor artists. I have been paying for Spotify premium for almost 5 years and really enjoy it. I think its affordable and they have a large variety available to interest everyone and their needs. I do not agree with censoring any artists music, podcast, etc. Everyone should be allowed to express their creativity and freedom of speech. If you dont like something, you dont have to listen. Our society needs to be more open-minded to include all viewpoints and quit canceling anyone who disagrees with their personal beliefs or agenda. Instead, lets have a discussion and learn something new. Thank you, Spotify for giving me the venue to listen to whatever I wish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opinion. Hate censorship. Making Joe Rogan apologize? Not good. Spotify employees should not decide what I should listen. Listeners should be educated enough to filter information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"too many ads. ADS:Usually I either get 1 ad or 4 ads in a row. I havent gotten a watch this ad to get no more ads for 30 minutes ad in days. Despite all the (not really that many) playlists I have Id leave Spotify in a heartbeat if another app opened. I get that some companies need money and so they need ads, but even the trash, money grab apps have less ads a day. Honestly if you can, ditch the mobile version and use the laptop/maybe desktop version. Id recommend but be aware of the ads. And I just got the same ad twice. They constantly beg for you to get premium. You begging me to get premium with ads every 3 minutes makes me want to uninstall Spotify. Most of the time when you go to another app you come back to a pop-up ad. Well a the very least Im a bit more impatient since I saw my favorite song flash before my eyes then an add Ive seen at least 20 times before in the last 1 1/2 days multiple times.Songs You Dont want to hear:Oh yeah and Spotify adds songs you dont want to listen to in your playlist. Its stupid, and Spotify should feel stupid. I could be listen to my playlist Literally just Megalovania and Ill hear Spider Dance and other songs I DONT WANT TO HEAR. And because of that I have 33 songs Ive hidden because I DIDN&#39;T WANT TO HEAR THEM. Why would you continue to keep a feature hated by all? To help me find songs completely unrelated to the songs in said playlist of a fandom or genre I have never showed any interest in? Well then they could make it its own feature, something like Find New Songs Or even let me have a choice to say Hey I very much dislike this song, can you please remove it? More like Hey Im going to hide this song so I dont see it, now continue giving me more songs I hate even moreEverything Mobile Spotify isnt:So Spotify has a mobile, and PC version (probably more but I cannot say for sure), youd think that Spotify would try and make the mobile version (from now on MV) able to have some of the core functions from the PC version (from now on PCV). Well no. One of the functions on PCV is that you can go back to the beginning of a song. I consider this a very important feature, but I guess me and Spotify aren&#39;t great minds since we dont think alike. Instead of being able to re-listen to your favorite song you can just sit there waiting possible hours How fun The good things about Spotify:-Well Spotify is a music app, so theres music right? Yeah (Well usually theres more ads then song but go off I guess) They really do an ok job at doing the only thing they need to do, which is have music And theres plenty of music You could probably search gunshots and something would show up. -The songs sound great normally, so Its probably better with premium right? Probably idk. (if you didnt make me want to delete the app then Id probably consider it) -But thats the thing Theres an option to upgrade So they probably advertise it well, right? No. -Now lets talk about podcasts. If theyre a music and other app then there must be podcasts Right? Well there are An you neednt worry about running out of options because there seems to be thousands or even millions Although Ive never really watched on it seems like its great -Why should I get this app? Well I think you should get this app because its a pretty good music app. You just have to be VERY patient So in conclusion, this app is sh*t with 10 flakes of gold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hate it. I hate it when spotify keep deleting accounts please solve this big issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship is wrong. For a moment, I thought Spotify had gotten it right.  Unfortunately they have proven that to be incorrect.  Ill be moving on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love. Ive been using Spotify for like... a year??? I would have given it a 5 but then for some reason it took away my permission to being allowed to listen to what I want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop Coverd miss information. Im calling for other artists to boycott Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom to speak. IF SPOTIFY EVER DECIDES  TO CANCEL JOE ROGAN I WILL IMMEDIATELY DELETE THE APP AS WELL AS MANY MILLIONS MORE  DO THE RIGHT THING SPOTIFY & DONT MAKE A DUMB MOVE OUT OF PEER PRESSURE OR MANIPULATION  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conspiracy Theory and Misinformation. Spotify pushes conspiracy theories and misinformation that are dangerous to public health and safety. I have uninstalled the app and will not come back if they keep conspiracy theorists on their payroll.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete your accounts. Everyone should delete their Spotify accounts until Spotify stops promoting false information about the Covid vaccination and about the seriousness of being positive for the virus.  There should be an emphasis on scientific facts and not false and misleading information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why use Spotify?. Ive used many apps over the years. All the ones you can trust that you dont have to worry about it getting banned from the appstore, will have Ads. So the ads dont bother me, its normal. But Spotify absolutely makes it so you 100% feel you have to buy Their packages, you only get 6 skips per hour? Really? I bet 90% of the people in this world wanna skip 70 songs in 3 minutes so they can find that special song theyre craving.And if you wanna have a playlist, say you make a playlist with 50 songs. You go to sleep then wake up and it now has 53 songs. Weird right? Well spotify adds songs they think youll like, and you cant even remove them from your playlist. (Maybe until further updates) but seriously??? Whichever employee added that to Spotify didnt really think ahead. If I wanna find new songs Ill go on your random playlists on the app, or ill listen to the radio to search for new stuff, I dont want the app forcing songs into my private playlists.And the absolute most ridiculous thing, if you spend 5 hours adding all the songs you enjoy, to your liked songs list. And you scroll down to listen to a Specific song. You cant. You Cannot listen to a song you chose, you have to click shuffle and hope it plays the song you wanna hear at that moment. Otherwise have fun listening to Rock music as you crave Opera or Rap.... enjoy those 6 skips per Hour...... If you wanna save money and just listen to songs for free, not paying for some weird subscription, this is not the app. You dont have any freewill here. (Unless you pay them, then its PaidWill)If youre wanting to add music to a playlist without anyone interfering, and also choose any song you want from your 1,200 options in your liked songs list, I recommend Soundcloud, or the radio, or anything.This app is just such a PayToWin type.I spent 10 hours yesterday searching for all the songs i have on Soundcloud and adding them on my new Spotify account. Which was like using google, is search, then add. Easy.But then after 10 hours when I wanna listen to a specific song, or even a specific Genre. I dont have any say in that. It says if you wanna select a song to play and have unlimited Skips. Please choose one of Our packagesIts ridiculous.Stick with the radio if youre a person who wants to use their money for what they want.At this point, id rather buy each CD from the Artists I like instead of paying some money greedy based company.Do like what soundcloud does, allow people to chose what they wanna listen to. But only have to deal with ads.Not like what you do, Spotify, ads, and no freewill in decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage app. Music quality is garbage and company is full of bad employees pushing their personal beliefs.  Do not give Spotify money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify practices humane business. I primarily keep my Spotify subscription for the Joe Rogan Podcasts and the fact that Spotify doesnt practice the criminal activity of other medias makes me very very loyal to Spotify. History will remember Spotify in a positive light. Thank you to everyone at Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship & No Customer Support. My account was hacked and being used by some German and of course theres no way to get a hold of Spotify or no way to get them to respond to get access back to your account. So I had to cancel my entire bank account and I started a new account because I like to listen and watch Joe Rogan. I have now canceled my second account unfortunately they wont even refund that money. Spotify continues to try to take money from my bank account but not provide the service that I signed up for. We will never subscribe to Spotify again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stay the best. I love Spotify and use it whenever I can.  Their selection of music has been unparalleled. I greatly regret Spotifys recent loss of many artists due to the podcasts of Joe Rogan.   Promoting known false narratives for profit at the expense of our citizenry is costing lives and our ties to each other.  You wouldnt allow it if I tried using your platform to do so.  Please act responsibly and remove him from your platform.  This issue is not a matter of free speech, but one of equal rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Car mode. If you wanted your phone to switch into driving mode then give that option for the account holder.  Otherwise people will still use their phones to change music or pod casts while in the car.  When its in driving mode you have to press more buttons to take it out while your still driving.  Therefore taking your eyes off the road longer.  I would think driving mode relives Spotify from liability, so I understand them trying to cover their a$$es.   But dont get it twisted.  It does not make the road a safer place, in fact it makes them more dangerous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cowardly Bowing to Censorship. I have loved Spotify for the years since I have found it because of the unparalleled access to high quality music, audiobooks and podcasts that support human freedom of thought and expression without unpleasant advertising. I am disturbed and sickened to see the company bow to calls for censorship that are coming for whatever reason. There is no reason that justifies the restriction of free expression which is a fundamental human right. If you have an issue with what someone is saying, you are free to avoid listening. If Spotify continues to censor and remove content, I will be canceling my subscription for the service and looking elsewhere for a company with more courage to stand up for freedom of expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the app. I love the app and services.   Stop trying to censor Joe Rogan.  Youre taking away from his craft.  If you wanted something different the Spotify should have hired someone else.  Stop trying to sensor joe rogan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify. Why do we need premium to listen to music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible faults in data management. For some reason after I transferred iPhones my account practically vanished and I was stuck with free Spotify, and only after literally hours with multiple support reps I finally got it back. Shame on Spotify for not having better data protection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censor?. Spotify lost my respect as soon as they censored all songs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete. Deleting Spotify due to misinformation and racist content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship is wrong. Spotify employees are censoring people like Joe Rogan for having opinions that are different from theirs. Spotify also pays artists a lot less then all other streaming platforms for the same amount of plays. The employees who attempted to censor Joe Rogan should be fired immediately because they violated first amendment rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So many issues on Spotify. **update for today: I just updated the app right now hoping the technical issues I mentioned would be fixed immediately. However, I checked the app just now and all the issues I mentioned are STILL not fixed. Therefore I have no choice but to change the rating from three stars to one star.

Reading my text. Every time some fast food or corporation is mentioned in a text I proceeded to get an advertisement on Spotify related to that companyIts too personal and invasive I dont want Spotify in my text messages period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spotify supports covid misinformation. Very irresponsible company blatantly supporting dangerous misinformation. They should be ashamed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misinformation. I am sorry to have to stop using Spotify until it changes its platform of allowing misinformation to be presented to the public concerning issues and in particular, Covid.I will also encourage my friends, families and fellow healthcare and first responders to stop using this platform completely until the possible time there are corrections made concerning individuals spreading potentially life threatening information.Please data check from reputable sources. The recent spread of misinformation must stopSincerely,Will Allen Peden, RN CEN CIC (Ret.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 step verification PLEASE. I love the app and have no problems with it OTHER THAN the fact that people all across the world seem to be able to access my account, no matter how many times I change my password. I do not want my end-of-the-year spotify playback to include all the music from these random people. Come up with a solution spotify",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify and censorship. I will deleted, uninstall, stop promoting and actively speak out against using platforms that censor. If people are offended they dont have to listen especially if they are only offended because of content thats over a decade old. Thats ok tho because its easy to go and support our music and content creators without ignorant 3rd parties like Spotify. In the end, you have limited yourself to being less than you could have been. Good job Spotify; you played yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app but it needs more security. I love Spotify and the Repeat shuffle playlist feature along with the top songs playlist of each passing year. But I really wish that Spotify would care about the safety and privacy of each account. My account got hacked yesterday from someone in the Ukraine. This startled me and which I had to reset and log out of every device with Spotifys log out feature. Please fix this soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep your politics to yourself. Spotify is CLEARLY supporting only one side of the political parties. If your not going to be impartial just stop This is a music app. Keep politics out of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stuck between a rock & a hard place. Not happy with Spotify stayed quite loyal to the company but recently the publicity has effected my opinion, I dont recommend them for the pure fact there employees wish to censor joe Rogan, essentially censoring freedom of speech Big companies shouldnt control the world &amp; shouldnt control which information gets put on the internet maybe monitor &amp; prevent false news &amp; propaganda but potiential truth mixed with freedom of speech based on opinion of well informed individuals shouldnt be controlled, very disappointed in Spotify, will be cancelling if they cant do better then that of YouTube... might aswell stick to YouTube music",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shameful. Allows their content creators to spread misinformation that purposefully harms listeners who dont know any better. Not to mention the allowance of bigotry, hate speech, and misogyny. Free speech is free speech up until the point it begins to cause undue harm to others. This is a fact that Spotify seems not to care about. Id encourage everyone to, in turn, stop caring about Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Give the option of a private account. I love this app the fact that the music is free with just a few ads is great and I love it I dont even mind the lack of skips since I dont skip any music BUT I want to know why they decided to give it a social media format. I dont like when others follow my account or like my playlists because my playlists are for me and the names are low key embarrassing. Toxic stalkers or exes be following and I hate that. I know theres an option to make the playlists private but the account is still public and I like the aesthetic of all my playlists on my account, why cant they just give a private account option where if you switch it on, people cant search your account, like your playlists, or follow you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Music not politics. Loved the app. Got it for music and to be able to listen to whatever I wanted to. But Spotify got involved in politics and silencing certain voices, which I feel shouldnt be their job. I will not support anything that chooses to silence ANY voice no matter what political side it represents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. Spotify keeps supporting free speech Ill keep supporting them. They stop? Im gone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be careful with data beaches. Is quite common (you can google it) to have your Spotify account breached and start receiving notifications of different unknown logins into your account from different parts of the world. Im not complaining about the Spotify layout and music app which is excellent, but Spotify lacks of security, just be careful, through Spotify hackers obtain your password and not only access to this app, they access to any other social media or plataforma that contains the password breached. Its a shame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Profiting on propaganda. I have unsubscribed from Spotify and am leaving a 1-star review due to the companys complete disregard for objective truth. Spotify has not only continually allowed Joe Rogan and his guests to spout dangerous lies about important scientific and human rights issues, but is also now solely responsible for paying him for and distributing his easily disprovable claims.Spotify has made clear they are happy to spread propaganda and lies as long as they can make money off of it. I will never support Spotify again. You have permanently lost a customer, and Im sure Im not the only one.Ill be relying on Apple Music until a better competitor rises up to knock Spotify out of the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political Agenda. Please keep Spotifys political views out of my music source, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take DisInformation Spreaders off the platform. Take Joe Rogan down. Allowing a conspiracy theorist who spreads covid-19 misinformation is unethical. I will not use Spotify again until Joe and others like him are down permanently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Locked out. Spotify locked me out of my account about 3 months ago and I just finally got in. The music you download deletes itself rendering it useless if you intend on using it later to preserve data, I noticed this about 6 months ago... I ended up being charged for the 3 months it locked me out. Essentially making my subscription for 6 months useless, and they make it very clear they dont offer refunds. Also to get rid of Spotify premium it wont let you do it in the app, and makes you use their website, theres no reason for this, its simply to make it more difficult for people to end subscriptions. I find this disturbing to think of people like my grandmother who would probably join for free, and then not know how to get rid of it and be leached off of. When thinking about it in this context it nearly seems predatory. Spotify should seriously consider fixing this issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I keep making the same complaints about the same technical issues for a whole month, and yet NOTHING is being done about it. Starting today I will not be using Spotify anymore until all the technical issues I mentioned below get fixed once and for all.** I really like Spotify so much. In fact I use it so much more than Tidal, thanks to the dont play music from this artist feature. I now feel comfortable and happy that I can play the music I want without and music I dont want shoved down my throat. I would give Spotify a four-star rating. However, Im having a lot more issues on Spotify Ive been dealing with for the past few weeks that needs to be taken care of right away. Its preventing me from give this app four or five stars because thats how much these technical issues bother me. 1) Normally when I go to an artists profile, I would always go to their albums, check out their top songs and the list of the songs on their albums, play the sample that lasts a few seconds, and then like their songs that gets added to my liked songs part of my profile. However, today and yesterday I go to an artists page to check out their top songs and their albums, and every time I press the track listing just to see the list of the songs, nothing is coming up Its not letting me see the list of the songs at all How am I supposed to press the like button on the songs if youre not going to let me see the songs in the first place? This technical problem needs to be fixed right away or Im afraid Im not going to be able to check out any artists songs or albums (especially their new albums). 2) Normally whenever they say that Ill have thirty minutes of ad-free music, I usually do. However, for the past few days I have this issue when they say Ill get thirty minutes of ad-free music, they play three ads in a row. Then after playing two songs, they play four MORE ads right after that Whats up with that? Why announce that Ill get thirty minutes of no ads and yet play this much ads anyways? This needs to be fixed immediately When you say youll play thirty minutes of ad-free, just do so Dont play that many ads. 3) I listen to a lot of Persian music. Its one of my top five most favorite genres, along with pop, R&amp;B/soul, hip hop, and Latin (lots of Spanish music). With that being said, I notice that out of all the genres I saw on Spotify, they dont have one genre for Persian music only. They have Afro, Arab, Desi, K-Pop, and Regional Mexican music. But no Persian. Even more weird is that every time I listen to Persian music, I get more recommendations for Arabic songs and playlists instead of Persian ones. I dont understand why. Why are you recommending ARABIC songs after I listen to a lot of PERSIAN songs? Dont get me wrong I like Arabic music, but I dont appreciate Spotify recommending songs and playlists from the WRONG genre and the WRONG language. Thats like recommending Spanish songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Portuguese music, or recommending Chinese songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Korean music. Thats NOT OK. So what needs to be done right away is: a) create another genre specifically for Persian music only, and b) recommend songs and playlists for the CORRECT language and CORRECT genres; in other words, when I say I want Persian music, I want PERSIAN music, NOT Arabic music. PERSIAN music. PERSIAN songs, albums, and playlists from PERSIAN artists. 4) Like I mentioned before I really like appreciate Spotify for giving us the dont play music from this artist option. However the only problem is that were only limited to choose 99 artists. Once I reached to the 100th artist, all the artists I muted before now all of a sudden appeared on my homepage and all the playlists recommended to me. Why is that? I thought I have a right to play music from whichever artists I want and block music from artists I dont want. Why am I limited to mute 99 artists? Why cant I mute more than that without having any of them shoved down my throat on my homepage? I want to be able to mute more than 100 artists I dont care for and dont support from my homepage. Its MY profile and MY listening choice. I have the right to mute as many artists as I want, just like I have the right to follow as many artists as I want. Please fix this issue immediately. Once these changes are made, I will change my rating from three stars to five stars immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cancel Spotify. Supporting racists and misinformation is irresponsible.  one star is stick to much for this app..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Driving warning obnoxious. Dont bow to Spotify legal team and get rid of the obnoxious safety warning that pops up every single time my phone connects to car stereo. Car stereos dont boot instantly, thus the warning will come up while driving If I have gmaps open phone will switch to Spotify to display there safety warning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"spotify is ruled by communist. garbage and not buying premium until i go underway, also give the users control over the music they want to listen to you TYRANTS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify are hiding something from you, and its horrible, heres why. I have been using Spotify for more than 5 years now and I have always used the free plan since I havent bothered to get Premium. But that wont stop Spotify from trying to convince me to pay for it, because I have discovered a ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING SECRET they dont want Spotify users to know. For the past year now, I have noticed that the 30 minutes of ad-free music they promise hasnt been feeling like 30 minutes at all and more like half of it. This has occurred so many times, that 1. I cant even count how many times its happened, and 2. They are clearly trying to pull the wool over my eyes by scamming me. For a company who has already gained top-tier success, are you kidding me? Do you really think I would fall for your obvious schemes to almost pressure me into purchasing your Spotify Premium? I cant say otherwise, this is a prime example of exploiting company policy to exploit their users, just so they can bend the rules and get away with a few extra bucks. Im not going to ramble on any more than I have now, but just so you get this in your probably thick heads, STOP SCAMMING YOUR CUSTOMERS SPOTIFY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Changing and choosing your Spotify Plan. Spotify is an Amazing app, Id choose it over any other music app. But, once you sign up it gives you free access to everything- no ads, free range to skipping songs, etc.- once for however long it lasts, then its over. Also, it doesnt give you an option to change your plan, at least on mobile, though you need to, to be able to get access free range again. I feel like its rather pointless. Id suggest giving the person an option to choose a plan and stick with it unless they feel like changing it. Other than that, I love this app very much Everything is organized and you can find any song you enjoy from any genre ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I dont agree with censorship. Im not interested in supporting a platform that thinks its role is to determine what I can/cant hear and doesnt allow me to decide for myself. I dont need Spotify to be my filter. Its not qualified to do so and cowardly not to stand up for free speech. If Joe Rohans material continues to be censored Ill be off your platform. Good luck appeasing the Neil Young typesthey are dishonest and will never go away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great for now. I love listening to Joe Rogan on your streaming service. I 100% support you not giving into people that would censor others viewpoints. I hope you continue to support free speech. I will always continue to use your service as long as you hold yourselves to that standard. I came to Spotify solely to listen to Joe Rogan. I found some other pods that I like while I was at. If it wasnt for Joe I wouldnt have used Spotify at all and if he is censored, or you start removing episodes I will go back to not using Spotify at all. Im sure that is true for millions of people. That all said I love your product and I hope it stays holding the same standards as it does right now. If I wanted to hear what the prevailing narrative is I can just go to cnn, nbc, msnbc, abc, etc because every tv station and every news station say the exact same thing. If youve seen one, youve seen them all. Dont be like that and you will continue to enjoy the listenership of millions. Thank you Spotify for standing behind Joe Rogan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can not get unlimited music. So Im very unhappy with the service can not get what I paid for and can not intouch with Spotify so far I have 2 accounts and still cant get what Im entitled to will be telling all my friends and family and will cancel my accounts if no one gets in contact with me absolutely discussing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love Spotify. The only thing I dont like is there is NO customer support by phone if you dont live in CA. Ive had to cancel and start all over because of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage. Im so sick and tired of you people restricting everything from the free version of spotify. You people are money hungry and selfish. All you want is for people to buy your over priced premium deal. Ive put up with this for over a year and Im done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Standards. There are not a shortage of music platforms from which to choose.  While freedom of speech is a foundation of this country so is the responsibility of those who provide a platform that enables other to have their voice heard. Nothing stops an individual from saying any sort of thing they wish but when a company not only allows documentable falsehoods that endanger others but to also profit from it one needs to make a decision.  For me, I can no longer justify using a platform that places profit over speech that endangers others    I will be removing Spotify from every device I have and hope others joint me as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cancelling. In line with Neil Youngs and Joni Mitchells choice, I discontinuing my Spotify subscription and removing the app from my mobile devices. Media outlets need to take a stand regarding use of their platforms for clearly harmful purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regretfully had to cancel. Your censorship is unacceptable. Shame on Spotify for succumbing to the mob. Freedom of speech must be protected at all costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Propaganda machine. Spotify is a cowardly propaganda machine for big pharma & global elitists.Why are people scared to hear information?- I will be canceling my membership & telling everyone else to do the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why do you need all of that private information that you track????. Ive been a customer for years, and to find out how much information you keep is shocking. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for you all to have that detailed information. Reminds me of Google",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a dangerous platform. Profiting from misinformation and hate. Stick to platforms that take accountability. I deleted Spotify and do not miss it at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is awesome. Spotify is committed to not cave to pressure to censor it contentGreat job Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WARNING: illegal to listen to spotify while driving. It is illegal to listen to spotify, even hands free, in my state while driving. This is because of the video ads and the fact that spotify demands to be in the foreground while ads are playing. Do NOT use Spotify whole driving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is anti free speech. Dont let spotify infect your life with their leftist natzi agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unconstitutional barring of freedom of speech. Spotify has no respect of freedom of speech. They have removed over 100 of Joe Rogans podcasts after flimsy accusations and defamation of character. If Spotify cared at all for whatever they deem is unacceptable they would have never offered Joe a deal or wouldve removed episodes long ago. They do it now to incite divisiveness among people and get rid of content which only they can distribute now. What a joke wake up people. They are all playing you and thats been the whole plan from the get go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not fully customizable. Im pretty upset that Spotify removed the option of reporting explicit lyrics. Ive taken all steps to prevent explicit lyrics, but daily recommendation songs are coming up with N**er, MotherF*cker, etc. on songs not marked as explicit lyrics. On many songs, I no longer have the option of blocking them either. As a parent of young children, Im upset that I cant block or prevent these songs from showing up. Customer service was not interested in helping. Once I can find a streaming service that allows me to block those songs, Ill take my business elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Usernames. Let us change our usernames. This is something people have been asking Spotify to do for years. Its ridiculous that it hasnt been implemented yet. (And no, display names arent the same as usernames, the fact that we can change those now is not what people have been asking for.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leaving this crap. Cancelling Spotify because I refuse to support any company that stands behind medical disinformation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Creepy and no privacy features. Had to delete Spotify because of the creepy podcasts and invasive tracking. I value privacy and truth. Spotify doesnt cut it. Decided to go with Apple Music instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify is for racists now. Joe Rogan racist statements literally ruined this app. Canceled my subscription after 6 years and deleted this disgusting app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political Censorship. Spotify targets Conservatives by censoring the name of some of my playlists. They had zero sexual, violent, or inappropriate curse words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify and Apple Music are essentials to my life. When I came and resided in Canada, I started to enjoy music at Spotify, though I had been a loyal user of Apple Music since it was launched in China many years ago. As the currently sole surviving foreign media provider in China Mainland, Apple always keeps an unbelievable lowest price around the world to Chinese users, equivalent to CA$1/mo. for students, CA$2/mo. for individuals, and CA$3/mo. for family, and no extra tax imposed, which is much lower than the market price of music streaming service in China Mainland (avg. price at least doubles than Apple). I guess the reason is Apple hope they can sustain a not-too-bad user base for future development in China Mainland and try to survive under such an adverse circumstance. If Apple steps a wrong pace, its media service department will probably be terminated by the government. Both Apple Music and Spotify indeed provide authentic high quality music to users, which is amazing, but unfortunately Spotify is banned in China Mainland. Unlike their competitors in China Mainland, such as Tencent QQ Music and NetEase Cloud Music, they have access to the original audio tape and therefore are able to make better sound. Now, I changed my Apple Music in China Mainland to Apple One in Canada, a more integrated Apple digital service package. For Spotify, I love it. I see it as a good complement to my Apple Music. I know they have so many songs overlapped in Canada, but why do I subscribe Spotify yet? Because only Spotify has a UWP app on Windows 10 and it has a beautiful user interface Brilliant green with deep black colour, so cool I would like to spend more $$$ on a good-looking App You did it Spotify, regardless of its outstanding audio quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wheres the technical support. I really dig the sound quality, the ease of finding songs, the ease of downloading songs to your device.Speaking of downloading you better get used to downloading to your device. Every three months, somebody somewhere erases all the songs on my phone I Cant contact anybody, because theres no way to contact Spotify. There is no technical support in the settings . Oh yeah I did find a contact us button you can push. But when you push that button it goes into the endless downloading screen.. myself I think this is bull crap if somebody from Spotify reads this review please contact me I got issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring verified information. According to a recent headline- Top Cardiologist: Spotify Never Contacted Me after Interview.  I have no interest in any platforms that ban free speech.  There are many unanswered questions about covid and all scientists and doctors deserve to be listened to- not just government condoned ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ADD TWO FACTOR. Really great, love using Spotify. App has the worst security ever though. So easy to spoof and get access to any account, seriously this service is not safe at all. They neeeeeeed to add two factor, hackers are getting smarter and so many of my friend accounts are getting hacked, even without breached passwords. Spotify, you have a security issue, and people have been asking since 2015 for 2FA. Please add it. Its getting really bad, this day in age your users need security. Really disappointed it hasnt happened yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Premium for Family HACKED for the FOURTH time. Cmon Spotify I pay enough money that surely you can protect ME, your PAYING customer We pay for Family and three of us, within a few months, have had to change our passwords because our account has been hacked. The worse was when it was my young daughters The trash the thieving, ignoramus listened to was a full out assault not only on my childs ears, but mine as well. Even more aggravating, it canNOT be deleted from RECENTLY PLAYED AND still tries to suggest the same nonsense. Thank GOD they have the explicit toggle switch otherwise it would have been able to play the same rubbish Good luck trying to get customer service to do anything Bunch of talking heads that they are, going in circles because all they do is give a pat answer WITHOUT actually reading the correspondence. Ridiculous The company surely doesnt care if I, only ONE customer, would cancel. $14.99 a month is NOTHING to them SPOTIFY FIX YOUR SECURITY YOU probably sell our information on the dark web Better yet, with the poor security you have, you just freely give it away Thank you very much for thatEdit: I forgot to mention that a search within my own music doesnt work. Even if one word is typed within the search bar, say more for example, it says I have nothing within my playlist for that search word, when in fact I do, multiple songs that have more within the title and even as the first word.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political agenda. One of the reasons I love music is to escape the noise of todays politics.  However Spotify continues to push their agenda front and center with political podcasts that cant be hidden.  I could understand if this was based on past listening buts its not.  When I called and asked if if could be removed or hidden I was informed it couldnt.  I could understand that if I wasnt a paying customer and I was using the free service.  Ill be canceling soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No misinformation policy. Money is more important than public safety to Spotify; otherwise they wouldnt host podcasts that spread factually incorrect information about COVID-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All speech should not be protected by bottom lines. I downloaded the app but I really do not use this service. I am deleting this app now and will ask others to boycott Spotify after sending this. The power of the masses might make a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Platforms have responsibilities. I like Spotify as a app, but  platforms have responsibilities. I find some of their content, namely Joe Rogan, problematic to put it kindly and pedaling false information to put it more bluntly. I celebrated Spotify ability to exercise who they choose to promote on their own platform, but I do not have to condone the people they give a platform to and plan to exercise my own rights through taking my viewership and dollars elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, today and yesterday I go to an artists page to check out their top songs and their albums, and every time I press the track listing just to see the list of the songs, nothing is coming up Its not letting me see the list of the songs at all How am I supposed to press the like button on the songs if youre not going to let me see the songs in the first place? This technical problem needs to be fixed right away or Im afraid Im not going to be able to check out any artists songs or albums (especially their new albums). 2) Normally whenever they say that Ill have thirty minutes of ad-free music, I usually do. However, for the past few days I have this issue when they say Ill get thirty minutes of ad-free music, they play three ads in a row. Then after playing two songs, they play four MORE ads right after that Whats up with that? Why announce that Ill get thirty minutes of no ads and yet play this much ads anyways? This needs to be fixed immediately When you say youll play thirty minutes of ad-free, just do so Dont play that many ads. 3) I listen to a lot of Persian music. Its one of my top five most favorite genres, along with pop, R&amp;B/soul, hip hop, and Latin (lots of Spanish music). With that being said, I notice that out of all the genres I saw on Spotify, they dont have one genre for Persian music only. They have Afro, Arab, Desi, K-Pop, and Regional Mexican music. But no Persian. Even more weird is that every time I listen to Persian music, I get more recommendations for Arabic songs and playlists instead of Persian ones. I dont understand why. Why are you recommending ARABIC songs after I listen to a lot of PERSIAN songs? Dont get me wrong I like Arabic music, but I dont appreciate Spotify recommending songs and playlists from the WRONG genre and the WRONG language. Thats like recommending Spanish songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Portuguese music, or recommending Chinese songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Korean music. Thats NOT OK. So what needs to be done right away is: a) create another genre specifically for Persian music only, and b) recommend songs and playlists for the CORRECT language and CORRECT genres; in other words, when I say I want Persian music, I want PERSIAN music, NOT Arabic music. PERSIAN music. PERSIAN songs, albums, and playlists from PERSIAN artists. 4) Like I mentioned before I really like appreciate Spotify for giving us the dont play music from this artist option. However the only problem is that were only limited to choose 99 artists. Once I reached to the 100th artist, all the artists I muted before now all of a sudden appeared on my homepage and all the playlists recommended to me. Why is that? I thought I have a right to play music from whichever artists I want and block music from artists I dont want. Why am I limited to mute 99 artists? Why cant I mute more than that without having any of them shoved down my throat on my homepage? I want to be able to mute more than 100 artists I dont care for and dont support from my homepage. Its MY profile and MY listening choice. I have the right to mute as many artists as I want, just like I have the right to follow as many artists as I want. Please fix this issue immediately. Once these changes are made, I will change my rating from three stars to five stars immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cool platform but . Spotify is a great concept and fairly good at what they do. What you dont know is that Spotify has more than its letting on. Ive used premium and regular (about a year on both) and the difference is astounding. Some other problems for non paying customers are -The app crashes on a regular basis even after a patch update it goes back to crashing after a couple weeks-you cant view individuals songs in an album you can only few the album and some of the songs it contains and if you want to listen to them you need to use the mandatory shuffle play option and it will mix in other songs made by the same artist or similar sounding ones        That can all be avoided if you switch to premium -the ads they play to convince you to go to premium are exceptionally annoying. they will contain anything from a car alarm going off, to ice skates cutting into the ice(after awhile it sounds like a metal fork on a glass plate), to an ringtone very similar to the Apple default ringtone-the algorithm its self has been weaponized. (I personally listen to my liked songs more than a playlist) when I try to listen to a variety of songs I will get a song that I really like and  it will play ever 5 or so songs at first this wasnt an issue but it started to play so much to the point where I start to dislike the song itself and it started to do this more and more. As my music taste would change the algorithm would continue to play my older songs for months after I was way past it and it continued as I pasted through different phases of music the algorithm would play catch-up giving me old songs that I was sick ofI used to love Spotify and the algorithm they devised but now I can see that the company has let their financial team start to make more and more choices. So much that I dont recognize them or what theyve become.Long story short just use Apple Music or download the mp3 files some where and play them through Nota player(another app)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Took family members off of my family plan. Because they didnt check their email for 7 days. Now Spotify says they cant get re-added back to this plan. Theyre blacklisted from my Spotify Family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Electronically Declined. I have broken my head.   Spotify is easy to operate even for someone who is electronically declined like me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Love the Spotify App. Ill pay to skip propaganda, choose my songs &amp; support only those artist I agree with. I love my play list options and also how I can download to listen where I dont have service. Worth the money as well to let my family have their own account on the family plan so my music is customized for only me Pandora what? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Really?. Youre forced to pay to change music (premium) and it consumes data, Ive found many other music players that are free and dont consume data. Better up your game Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify knows me better than I know myself. Would gladly give Spotify my data or dna anything they need. Idc I dont even know anything about music it just is the perfect app and keeps me sane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify. Why wouldnt you use Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Switching to Apple Music. All of my friends and I will be switching to Apple Music if one more of my playlists gets made private by the ownerEDIT*** It happened again. Im officially canceling Spotify forever and switching to Apple Music.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spotify rules. spotify rules and i use it constantly. massively useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One change. Spotify is the best thing in my life, the only reason why I dont give it five stars is one simple problem. Why limit a user to 4 pins it makes no sense, as its my account how does it make any sense on limiting the organization of ones own music??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misinformation. Spotify supports misinformation and letting people spread lies causing death and pushing a very dangerous agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Should Be Removed From App Store. Many bad decisions these past years. This latest incident is just the straw that broke the camels back. Everyone, cancel your subscriptions right now. I have also cancelled mine and will be asking everyone around me to do the same. Spotify supports vaccine misinformation. Shame on you Spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Have you reads their terms and conditions?. Over Spotify. Its just another piece of spyware, like Facebook, google and the rest. Try reading the Ts and Cs youve already signed up to. Might take an hour, or three. You are just there to have your data sold.Its  another nice idea ruined by becoming a near monopoly service. The search for a music provider who isnt  near spyware continues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleted Spotify. You can have Rogan, thats your prerogative and agenda. I wont be back as long as I believe Spotify gives license to racist and hateful voices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify earns my business. Companies standing on the right side of commonsense behavior and freedom earn my business. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Remove conspiracy theories. Sadly, Spotify is being used to spread harmful and false conspiracy theories and Spotify is not doing anything about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Covid misinformation. Spotify amplifies and is therefore responsible for dangerous and reckless Covid misinformation that literally and directly leads to death. Shame on you. I will be canceling my account until he is removed from this platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Easy to get account stolen. Heres a subscription that allows you to listen to music, including hackers, if they got your account once, you can bet they can again and again. Spotify does nothing to protect their users with a 2-factor authenticator, instead making the excuse that its to make it &#34;simple&#34; for the users. More like they make it &#34;simple&#34; to get compromised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joe Rogan. Ive been waiting for Spotify to do the right thing about disseminating false Covid information.  A warning label isnt it.  I hope they do better as there are other services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unless paid, use a different music service. Spotify has gotten cocky. They dont support the same functionality on the phone as they do on the computer. You cant stream albums, play specific songs, and I am sure a whole lot more. Like most market leaders, they are no longer concerned with maximizing value so much as profit. So unless you are 100% onboard with cutting these guys a check every month, use a different streaming service on your mobile device",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why. Can someone explain me why cant i buy Spotify premium on my phone? Am i really obligated to do it on a pc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does Spotify need access to devices on my network. Thank you apple for making companies notify us before connecting to devices on our networks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mis information. Spotify allows certain hosts to spew mis information. I would choose a different format,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spotify has lost its way . Spotify and Mr. Ek have lost their way in the pursuit of profits at all costs. In his reject blog post, Mr. Ek completely missed the point, that Spotify is providing a platform and megaphone for Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories. His offering of warning labels is a crass abdication of Spotifys ability to prevent the misinformation from being spread, rather than offering mea culpas after the damage is done. I will be canceling my Premium Account and encourage others who value our collective health and our medical workers to do likewise. Their are many other sources of streaming content with better ethics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship?. Unsubscribing because you are removing JRE episodes.  Joe Rogan is the only reason that I pay for spotify.  I dont agree with censoring media.  This is ridiculous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify review. I understand we bear a penalty for taking advantage of the free version of Spotify but I strongly object to the frequency of the adsand more objectionable is raising the volume of the adsI consider that ploy to be abusiveXavier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Missing 2 FA and extra security. I love Spotify to death and its hands down one of the best music streaming apps out there to date, however; its missing the security of personal information and overall security in general My account has been logged into so many times by others around the world who I have no clue who they are. The emails they send out about your account being logged into doesnt even help out or sometimes I dont even get a email. They need to add a 2FA and a way to see which devices are connected to your account. Im paying for a subscription like others for a reason and we are getting taken advantage of by hackers. Im tired of finding random playlist on my recently played section or my music skipping randomly to a artist Ive never listened to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standards. Spotify has all the right standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No censorship. I appreciate Spotify for avoiding the pressure to sensor controversial artists and podcasters like Joe Rogan. Freedom of speech is very important to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Misinformation for money. Im uninstalling Spotify. I dont need toxic Joe Rogan on my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why 4 Not 5. This app has the smartest algorithm; was able to figure out my taste in music and the flow I like after hearing 3 or 4 songs and of course after I selected my preferred artists. And that is all only by using the free version. I was totally hooked after a week and subscribed to become a premium member, which I got one month for free, but as soon as I traveled (I live between two countries and travel extensively for work) I realized that I was not being to enjoy my premium membership because my country of payment does not match the country  visiting/residing in. It was not easy to change nor to understand the website with all the auto change of language, so I finally gave up and asked google for help, and apparently Spotify cannot accommodate me as a customer, not that they said it to me officially, but in other words, the way I run my finances and subscriptions, given that I live between two countries, was not a case that Spotify could much do with it. Of course am fully aware that there are copyrights issue and different countries have different laws in place to regulate content. However, Spotify, which is a European company in the EU would not accept payment methods also for different countries in the EU, although other companies, such as my mobile carrier accepts linking my account to a bank located in the EU. I think I will continue using my free account but will not set it as my default music app, only given my situation.I hope this review was helpful..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of Speech. If you love freedom and hate tyranny, Spotify is for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Violation of 1st Amendment. Spotify has gone woke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Im off Spotify until they stop the censorship. Disgraceful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the truth. Your not valid if u dont use spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is what I need. iI certify got to have Spotify make me feel free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Content does not follow own policies. Choosing money over everything even their own rules. Not my kind of company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dishonest. Spotify blocks access to the Joe Rogan Experience with expressvpn. Guess they need to sell your data to pay for it. No thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DONT GET THIS APP AMAZON MUSIC IS WAY BETTER AND HERES WHY. Alright I have many problems with Spotify.1. Limited skips Why do you do this It is so Annoying and just a tactic to get more money. Stop people should have to spend money to skip a song2.Not being able to take songs of playlistsWhy cant we take songs of playlists why? I see nothing wrong with want to remove a song you dont like from a playlist that you do like. 3. Songs you addThere are soooo many problems with this but Im only going to list 3. First what is you in the car with your young sibling and you turn on some music and what plays first is a song you guys added that has cuss words and stuff or is just inappropriate. Next what if you just really dont like the song. With limited skips there a good chance you arent going to be able to skip it AND you cant take the song off the play list. Third you might not think this is a big problem but it is My friends little sister has epilepsy, and shes very sensitive. All sorts of thing can cause seizures. 4. Listening to other songs before the one you clicked on.When I click on a song Spotify makes me listen to other songs and adds before the song I choose. I dont have a big problem with this I can live with it unlike the last one. But Im just asking maybe one add or something. I dont want to listen to 3 other songs before the one Im trying to listen to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lacking Security. I used to believe Spotify was the best streaming platform. It was the right trade off between convenience and control. However I discovered through my own experience that Spotify has a major problem with security. Not only was my account hacked, but after some brief online queries it seems that many people shared my experience. As much as I enjoyed using Spotify I cant stand behind a company that wont make solid attempts to secure the accounts of their users. My warning to anyone reading this review is to use Spotify at your own risk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why is Spotify taking off music to support COVID misinformation?. cant support a service that chooses the side of spreading COVID misinformation over streaming actual music, you know what the service is actually supposed to be about until they decided they want to compete with the likes of Info Wars and Alex Jones, I guess morals are for sale. Stop spreading hate and misinformation and start getting back to what used to make the service great, the focus on music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Propaganda distributor. Spotify distributes right wing, anti vaccine and Fascist propaganda.  Im deleting the app from my phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can almost get the basics right. We cant forgive an app just because its a monopoly. Usability is still import and the ux of this app is borderline unusable. No separation of queue and stack functionality(ie. no play next button and the add to queue button does whatever it wants) history makes no sense (just try replaying history from a selected point) and there is no way to block songs or artists. Be better spotify team.Other than that integrations are what makes this and why everyone uses it, good job api team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No more censoring. Spotify is great, but stop censoring things that are not popular. People have a right to speak and to hear opposing opinions, thats what the basis of the right to free speech. Other than that I like Spotify",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dump Joe Rogan. The only reason Im maintaining my Spotify account, indeed the only reason I have it in the first place, is because my kids like it. You should be spending $100 million on responsible science based content like the Skeptics Guide to the Universe, not on socially irresponsible content such as Joe Rogans podcast. On this Spotify you are on the wrong side of history, and putting profits and popularity above evidence and reason. Im with Neil Young.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joe Rogan says too many racial slurs. As an African-American I say we remove ourselves from this platform, we are not respected by Spotify so lets not consume their content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Responsibility. For years I never gave any thought to the editorial responsibility that Spotify has.Keeping Joe Rogen on and paid so well is a choice. I cant support or appreciate any platform with more than one star that behaves in such a way.No, I dont have the usual social accounts and no I dont pay for Spotify anymore. I think its time to delete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech is Essential. Thank you Spotify for being at least slightly more open to letting people speak their beliefs on different topics. Our voices should never be silenced just because of personal opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its 2020 fix it. I made my spotify back in 2013 and unfortunately I made it through a facebook account that wasnt under my own name.  I have no way to personalize it or make it my own apart from deleting the account and with it all my playlists, which would be heartbreaking. I wish there could be a change with the policy regarding facebook made accounts but unfortunately I doubt it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just pointless. Although its great if you dont have anything else, it still needs wifi and doesnt let the person download music incase they go on a run without paying, theres ads for Spotify itself every 30 minutes, I highly recommend using something else or purchasing imusic so you can get offline privileges without paying. And youre really limited to what you can do without premium, you cant even change songs more than a few times or gk back in a song.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doesnt support privacy. Signing up and it doesnt allow me to finish until I DISCONNECT MY VPN. Haha what a joke. Huge red flag. back to Apple Music. Also add an undisclosed option for gender. We know your ads will target women with parenting and baby ads like why would someone (uninvolved in that lifestyle) want to hear that. But I can already see you dont value privacy at all. You track track track and sell users private info. Im unimpressed even before touching the site. I Was going to give this platform a try but Ill stick to whats not broken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uses cellular data without permission. Spotify turned itself onto online mode when I was on cellular data, despite the fact that I have cellular data off for the app. This needs to be fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boycott Spotify. I will not use Spotify until Joe Rogan is brought to be responsible for his information about COVID information and Neil Youngs music is returned to play on Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stupid push to change the privacy settings. Today i had my screen blocked by notifications pushing me to change my privacy settings so the app can track me. What a stupid thing to do to customers who already paying a monthly subscription. Is it a way to bypass Apple ? Switching over to Deazer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do the right thing Spotify. Do the right thing on who you pay Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"See what devices are logged in. Spotify overall is a great app but my family has noticed that random russian songs start playing, so we believe that our accounts keep getting hacked. There should be a feature to see what devices are logged into your account as another privacy feature. Random songs start playing from other devices. If you guys could add this privacy feature it would make things a whole lot easier and less stressful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leaving over Spotifys support of misinformation. The app and service are fine, but Spotify doesnt offer anything that Tidal and Apple Music dont. In fact, Spotifys interface forces me to look at Joe Rogans podcast in the center of my main screen and doesnt offer a way to change it. I do not appreciate this constant promotion of political and healthcare misinformation that is indirectly causing hundreds of excess Covid deaths per day. Spotify has the blood of tens of thousands of misinformed Americans on their hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify supports profits over misinformation. Sad to say that a business would take such a divisive stand when we need true and accurate information more that ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"VPN support. The app is great and my VPN (expressVPN) works with it for the most part, until I try to launch The Joe Rogan Experience. Then I guess your privacy isnt that important to you. No thanks spotify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleted my account. I am disgusted at Spotifys decision to support Joe Rogan and his amplification of racist and anti-science viewpoints. Both Spotify and Joe Rogan have an obligation to the truth given their massive platforms and influence over millions of people. They are both currently ignoring that obligation, and I am therefore deleting my account and moving to Apple Music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks to your developers and curators. Ive been a premium subscriber for a long time, and youre the only music platform I love. The app gets better and better with time, and I can always find a perfect soundtrack to each activity among your Spotify-curated playlists. Your Devices Available feature to control Spotify across my Apple devices and TV is genius. THANKS Please give attention to these areas, if you can: (1) SETTINGS: I access this frequently, but its awkwardly placed on the top right of the home screen, and not in a logical place on the main left dashboard along with other controls. When I listen to somber music, podcasts, vocal training, or odd genres, I dont want my to post my listening activity. I change this setting all the time, and its frustrating to have followed a nice rabbit trail to a fresh discovery and have to back all the way up to home just to change a universal app setting. Or when Im listening across the electronic genre, or when Im in the flow, I want a longer crossfade, but thats strange with classical music, for instance. Please please place this somewhere more persistent. (2) DISCOVERY: Im stuck in a suggested loop of the same droll music that I listen to only during my morning reading. My Release Radar and Discover Weekly playlists have been overrun by one genre, and I cant seem to un-do it. Ive completely purged my Liked Songs (a very, very tedious endeavor), Ive liked many new things, and I listen to diverse things throughout the day. Where is Spotify learning my preferences from?? Is there a way to purge my machine-learned cache and start over? I feel like Im missing out on a lot. (PS: the worst was when I was babysitting and saved Baby monkey going backwards on a pig for the kids. Getting the song out of my recommendations was almost as hard as getting it out of my head.)(3) ORIENTATION: When my phone is on the treadmill, its sideways. Your interface doesnt rotate though. And the buttons are way too small when Im bouncing around. I have to stop running when I want to skip songs or jump to an album from a current song. Its a nice excuse when Im out of breath, but its still frustratingand hopefully simple to fix. Please, think about designing a modified interface when the phone is rotated that increases the tap area, contrast ratios, and maybe even changes some of the displayed features, like go to artist or go to album or play radio from track. Maybe explore a new play similar BPM feature? And if you design and usability-test any workout mode, make sure the phone is bouncing wildly(4) ACCESSIBILITY: Im shocked that youve made it this long with such low contrast ratios and small type, especially on the phone. I have eagle-eye vision, but when I use your app in sunlight, Im mostly guessing what Im tapping on. Its like song roulette. (5) SEARCH: Any chance you could give us more ways to discover new artists? Top 50 by genre, search by chord, within lyrics, by keyword searching within artist profiles, by language or country of origin... I dont know whats in your data repository Theres a lot of great stuff to be mined from the less-discovered artists and regions, but we need more robust tools to find it. Right now my favorite way is the Starbucks Discovery playlist and artist-curated inspiration playlists. Ok, thanks for listening Thanks for sustaining our sanity in a world of shut-ins",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spreads Misinformation. Spotify supports the spread of misinformation and lies that help continue the covid pandemic. They are responsible for platforming lies that have lead to the deaths of thousands of people. When called to take responsibility for their actions they stay silent and continue to support Joe Rogan while actual artists and musicians leave the service in droves. They have also made it so that you are unable to deactivate your account and cancel subscriptions. So they only way to cancel your service is to call you credit card company and have them cancel any charges. Spotify deserves to fail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data. Really loved Spotify, I was able to play all my downloaded music with the cellular data turned off. But the new update made it now where you have to have cellular data on in order to play any music, even if downloaded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shame on you. Censoring free speech is shameful Spotify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cancel Culture. We had faith in you Spotify but you let me down. Cancel culture is not cool. You cant censor what you want. Its all censorship or no censorship. When everything is revealed, we will remember all of you apps, companies, medical institutions, etc. that kept useful and reliable information from people. The fact that you are willing to help destroy humanity by protecting a certain narrative through the censorship of an opposing narrative, does not indicate you are unbiased. I delete my account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Speech. Proud that Spotify is standing up for free-speech. One can always turn off or not listen to something. But no one has the right to tell anybody else what they can or cant listen to or can and cant say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No Censorship. Spotify censors, America cancels. Goodbye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring conversation. Spotify has done a wonderful job of being a provider of content right up until they decided to join the pathetic weak group of small minded liberals who have deemed Joe Rogan too controversial for their world view. Time to grow a spine Spotify and stand for truth and valid conversation among Americans who simply have questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Plays anything but the album you select. I understand that having a free account has its limitations on Spotify. Still, when you select an album to play, Spotify mobile will play completely different songs by the same artist. Sometimes, itll also play a song youve never heard of and never wanted to listen to, because you had hoped tapping shuffle play on an album would play that *particular* album. When completely different songs play, it doesnt compel me to do anything beyond closing the Spotify app on my phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Customer service. Great app, do not download or update your version if you are using an old iOS. I received an email from Spotify informing me a Russian had accessed my Spotify acc, if it was you? Do nothing if it isnt you, change pw. Great good idea, or so I thought, it was at this point I *^%*+^% up. Changed my pw, great, oh what about family? No they arent affected separate acc, brilliant signed everyone out inc me on my old iOS iPad, used for the sole purpose of listening to Spotify in the kitchen, set up to rocking speaker system with FiiO amazing sound. Got back home, new pw nothing, called CS arrogant as always told me to uninstall my version, school boy error, now unable to download compatible version iPad now in the bin. Stroppy thing at CS Spotify advise was youve an iPhone 12 max pro use that insteadBe aatch I leave my iPad at home for my disabled mum how can I leave my phone?.Vile condescending arrogant Scandinavian with more money than sense looks down her nose at us because we iOS poor, discrimination at its best. Ive now invented iOS snobbery.The app is frustrating you cant delete on the fly from a playlist without scrolling through my list which this particular one is 2678 songs long and you have to look for blue txt before editing then pressing delete by which time youve lost the will to live. I dont those will be published, its too much like the truth, it all has to pretend its  these days  poor Mum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A review. Ive had Spotify for almost a year now, no premium, the quality of the music is great But let me list some complaints.1. When Im listening to music, sometimes the music pauses randomly. Its very annoying, especially when Im singing to it.1 1/2. Itll also pause, and just stop completely, crashing the app, putting me back at the beginning of the song I was listening to.2. I dont mind the ads, but theyve been getting insanely long, or they are constant, not giving me a single break after each song.3. I keep wondering why we cant change the image and description on our playlists, for some reason we can only do this on computers, not exactly a complaint, I was just curious.4. I get you want us to buy premium, but only 6 skips and hour? You can at least give us 10 or at least more than 6.5. Why cant their be a Notification Center for Spotify? Like in the app? Its a weird question, but I think it would help so that we would know if our followed artists have made a new song, or if someone has followed us, stuff like that Im sorry that I sound like a Karen ;-; so Ill list the pros of this app:1. You can listen to it with your phone off, any other app can do that, but just saying2. I recommend playing the song Yu want to listen to in a shuffle, because it opens up new songs that you can listen to Its how I found a majority of the songs I listen to.3. It has almost every song you can think of Even the weird ones.4. You can listen to it with bluetooth :) like if you wanted to connect it to your tv or speakerI give this app 4 - 4 1/2 stars.Theirs probably many more details I cant think of, whoever read this review, thank you And have a good day  Really though :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Username. You should be able to change your username thats the only thing I dont like about Spotify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lack of transparency. Spotify needs to be transparent about streaming numbers. Theyre not providing paying customers their guidelines and engaging in questionable practices to help certain artists in the charts over the truth You have lost credibility and my loyalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Huh. .. why are all of my private playlists now listed as public?? Spotify, I have peoples names on some of those, cmon. dont expose me haha. Would love if we could safely put those back on private and get rid of the add/remove from profile thing. Ahh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app. But since we are in quarantine we should at least get free Spotify premium until quarantine is over,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So many issues on Spotify. **update for today: It has been two days since I addressed how issue #1 just started coming back again (where every time I keep pressing an artists song list and it wont let me see the songs like I mentioned before), and yet Spotify STILL didnt fix this issue. Therefore I will not be using the app anymore until this technical issue gets fixed immediately. Until then, Im giving Spotify a one-star rating.** I really like Spotify so much. In fact I use it so much more than Tidal, thanks to the dont play music from this artist feature. I now feel comfortable and happy that I can play the music I want without and music I dont want shoved down my throat. I would give Spotify a four-star rating. However, Im having a lot more issues on Spotify Ive been dealing with for the past few weeks that needs to be taken care of right away. Its preventing me from give this app four or five stars because thats how much these technical issues bother me. 1) Normally when I go to an artists profile, I would always go to their albums, check out their top songs and the list of the songs on their albums, play the sample that lasts a few seconds, and then like their songs that gets added to my liked songs part of my profile. However, today and yesterday I go to an artists page to check out their top songs and their albums, and every time I press the track listing just to see the list of the songs, nothing is coming up Its not letting me see the list of the songs at all How am I supposed to press the like button on the songs if youre not going to let me see the songs in the first place? This technical problem needs to be fixed right away or Im afraid Im not going to be able to check out any artists songs or albums (especially their new albums). 2) Normally whenever they say that Ill have thirty minutes of ad-free music, I usually do. However, for the past few days I have this issue when they say Ill get thirty minutes of ad-free music, they play three ads in a row. Then after playing two songs, they play four MORE ads right after that Whats up with that? Why announce that Ill get thirty minutes of no ads and yet play this much ads anyways? This needs to be fixed immediately When you say youll play thirty minutes of ad-free, just do so Dont play that many ads. 3) I listen to a lot of Persian music. Its one of my top five most favorite genres, along with pop, R&amp;B/soul, hip hop, and Latin (lots of Spanish music). With that being said, I notice that out of all the genres I saw on Spotify, they dont have one genre for Persian music only. They have Afro, Arab, Desi, K-Pop, and Regional Mexican music. But no Persian. Even more weird is that every time I listen to Persian music, I get more recommendations for Arabic songs and playlists instead of Persian ones. I dont understand why. Why are you recommending ARABIC songs after I listen to a lot of PERSIAN songs? Dont get me wrong I like Arabic music, but I dont appreciate Spotify recommending songs and playlists from the WRONG genre and the WRONG language. Thats like recommending Spanish songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Portuguese music, or recommending Chinese songs and playlists to someone who mainly listens to Korean music. Thats NOT OK. So what needs to be done right away is: a) create another genre specifically for Persian music only, and b) recommend songs and playlists for the CORRECT language and CORRECT genres; in other words, when I say I want Persian music, I want PERSIAN music, NOT Arabic music. PERSIAN music. PERSIAN songs, albums, and playlists from PERSIAN artists. 4) Like I mentioned before I really like appreciate Spotify for giving us the dont play music from this artist option. However the only problem is that were only limited to choose 99 artists. Once I reached to the 100th artist, all the artists I muted before now all of a sudden appeared on my homepage and all the playlists recommended to me. Why is that? I thought I have a right to play music from whichever artists I want and block music from artists I dont want. Why am I limited to mute 99 artists? Why cant I mute more than that without having any of them shoved down my throat on my homepage? I want to be able to mute more than 100 artists I dont care for and dont support from my homepage. Its MY profile and MY listening choice. I have the right to mute as many artists as I want, just like I have the right to follow as many artists as I want. Please fix this issue immediately. Once these changes are made, I will change my rating from three stars to five stars immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly should be illegal. Not the greatest. Multiple accounts had been created with my credit card. Theres no actual way to reach customer service. When I finally did after trying for months they said the charges could be refunded and they would be cancelled. Its been about two years now and I still have gotten charged $10 a month for a service I dont use and never subscribed to. Honestly should be illegal so Ive given up trying to contact for help and stuck with it. The app also does not work and is linked to a Facebook which I also did not do but thats just the beginning of the Spotify nightmare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship troubles. Spotify have now started cancelling songs they dont like along with potential artists. Ive stopped my premium subscription not after many years. I will not engage with companies that are against free speech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supports racism. Ive canceled my subscription and deleted my Spotify app because they support racism Joel Rogan unbelievable that they would side with such a low life individual. Its for the almighty dollar so I suggest everyone canceling their subscription and deleting the Spotify app. Make horrible companies like this go away One love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spotify Primium. I feel that the limitations of not having Spotify premium is extremely irritating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Supporting harm. Im super dossapointed that Spotify is continuing to give a platform to a podcaster that has been spouting Covid misinformation and harmful views about the trans community. I just cancelled my account with them, I hopeYou do too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great changes. Finally they let you change your Spotify name and picture through the mobile app That took way too long to come through on the app. But other than that everything else works great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forces me to make devices vulnerable by blocking VPN. I use a VPN on my devices to protect my privacy. Even if I use a VPN server in my own city, Spotify blocks the connection. Makes the whole experience rather annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-Science. Spotify spreads false information about Covid. Get your music and podcasts elsewhere. Spotify is part of profits over peoples safety machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not worth giving them your $. Spotify was an annoying app to begin with but now that theyve chosen misinformation and $ over ethics I know its a trash company for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking data & sharing across apps. Really like Spotify, I moved from Apple Music. However now that I see the tracking and sharing of my data across apps, Im giving them 90 days to stop, after that its back to Apple Music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forcing me to click Choose for app tracking is bad PR. I was greeted with a new tracking feature to allow tracking. It said I could go change it in settings later. The only choice I was given in the window was to Choose it. Dirty pool Spotify  Ive turned it off and stopped using Spotify. When my kids graduate and get their own accounts, Im closing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just depressing. Spotify, using this app is like watching a good kid fall into drug addiction. Why do you keep making horrible changes that your users don&#39;t want? Why must you force users further and further away from their saved music. June 2020 update that brings you to the artist&#39;s public page is USELESS. If I wanted to see that, I can always search for it. If this is to increase revenue, (I can assume this is the only possible reason) it is a dirty pathetic trick spotify devs. Your app has gotten worse and worse over the past two years or so. Someday I will actually be forced into Apple Music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom is Speech. Spotify is the latest participant in cancel culture Grow a spine, this is about many choices for all. Individuals have the right to choose what to listen to and what to pass on. Ironically the same people that have been pro choice for years are against choices in most other arenas. Like thousands of others back to looking for another place to find my music.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep leading the way. I love Spotify and I use it everyday, all the time. Thank you for not caving into the pressure of censorship. God bless you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please bring the option to remove/block followers. Cant believe how Spotify still hasnt implemented this option even after receiving thousands of requests from users for privacy concerns?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Putting limits on your free users shouldnt be the way. I have used Spotify for at least three years now. And each year it has gotten progressively worse. I understand that I am not paying for premium but what I dont understand is why you feel the need to limit the actions of free users as if to force them to buy the over priced premium plan. Ill be honest: this app gets a solid three stars from me. I only put one because Im really hoping that some of these things will get fixed. The reason I feel compelled to write this review is because for some reason the app wont play once I shut my phone off or switch applications. Im fully aware that this could just be a bug but I feel like I wouldnt be surprised if all of a sudden I start hearing that one of the benefits of premium is having your music play when the app is closed. If this is the case then I am going to stop using Spotify entirely. Not only can you not play the songs you want, not skip songs, not have any choice as to what music goes into your playlist, but now if this happens I can no longer play the music outside of the app? The only reason Im still using this app is because it has all my playlists. But I think Im about ready to just take the hour or two that it would take to put my songs into playlists on another service. Again, I know that Im not paying for premium but I feel like free users shouldnt be taken advantage of. I cant even recall the number of times that Ive been told watch this add for thirty mins of ad free music and then two minutes after doing that receive another ad. To be honest I dont think I would really even care all that much about the ads if you gave app users the same experience they would get for free on a computer. This app has been something that I rely on for music over the years but I feel like it hates me. I want to enjoy this app and I dont want to feel like Im being ridiculed for not being able to buy premium every time I open the app. Every time I hear an ad for Spotify premium I actively want to buy it less than I already did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. The best with important information about everything that concerns us and more secure than Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. I get up to date information without the news bias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 years & done, privacy policy (Europe is fine). IF YOU ARE IN AMERICA DO NOT DOWNLOAD TWITTER UNTIL THEY REVERT THIS UPDATE IF YOU ARE IN AMERICA DO NOT DOWNLOAD TWITTER UNTIL THEY REVERT THIS UPDATEBeen done with Facebook and Instagram for years because of this. I want to all caps and profane this whole review, which shows the level of product you had. Taking away the option to opt out of personal ad data means Im deleting my personal and sports account. All I can do is ask why why why why why why demand this level of data from me? I dont see money being that important compared to the info possible to twerk peoples brains (mind the apostrophe). What I have to knowand dont know how to get tois deleting my accounts without agreeing to this.  If I automatically agree and the OK button is merely a formality Im done with any social program for life and will be voting strictly for PEOPLE TO LEGISLATE THESE DATA COMPANIES UNTIL THERES A TRUE GLASS WALL DIVIDING WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THE CONSUMER. IF YOU ARE IN AMERICA DO NOT DOWNLOAD TWITTER UNTIL THEY REVERT THIS UPDATEIF YOU ARE IN AMERICA DO NOT DOWNLOAD TWITTER UNTIL THEY REVERT THIS UPDATEBy all means please reach out Twitter because USING THIS CORONAVIRUS TO GET THIS UPDATE THROUGH DISCRETELY is so impossible to defend that you better respond or should be locked from the app store until theres an investigation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Open Source of Information and Access. Unlike Facebook information flowing through Twitter is available to anyone regardless of having a direct relationship with another user. I find out about news here first and I love the freedom of knowing I have access to this information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased social media . You control what information people can access to, you control their mind ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy updates constantly. Not sure that I have any privacy with any social media pertaining to the social media app grabbing all my information i.e. access to your contacts, camera, video camera and other things on your phone really without permission. App isnt bad but could be better at news updates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Why does this app collect so much data? Useful app awful policy in US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal Info. There is no legitimate reason to track that much personal information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. This form of social media is wonderful. My only problem w/social  media is the privacy issue. NO SOCIAL MEDIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SHARE YOUR INFORMATION W/ANYONE INCLUDING THEIR AFFILIATES W/WHOM YOU DONT HAVE A PRIVACY AGREEMENT WITH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great information. I find it biased, it rates you socially by who you are, no equality. It is very unique and I love being able to see my political feeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great source of information. Im a late bloomer by intention. I had too much going on and didnt have a good feeling about social media. Twitter was my first choice over Facebook and I havent regretted it. It allows me to get to know people I wouldnt necessarily have the opportunity to discover.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mindful of limitation and values. Access to Social Media is subject to -of course what you access and allow . At the moment I have limited what I access so I am probably not getting a true appraisal . Hope that Twitter monitors subversive elements vigorously yet allowing a free exchange of ideas and information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Info. Great to keep tabs on your favorite people on social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Power of communication. It takes a superior media platform to disseminate public information worldwide. Glad to state without reservation  Twitter got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Source of news. The power of social media to connect people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont recommend. Facebook and Instagram are way better than this app. So many politics & false information is spread without check. Deleted and wont come back. I recommend you do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media. Why social media is important. In the early days of television and news, majority of the media was suppressed by the intelligence agencies. See Mockingbird case. Social media is the new checks and balances promised by President James Madison. His quote If men were all angels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good. Perfect for getting information unlike insta and Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good for Information. Mostly used after no assess of Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberal bias. Censoring and manipulating data. Twitter and Facebook are manipulating data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensors. Social media that is bias and sensors conservative views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. They will sell your information to foreign countries and silence your free speech.  0 stars isnt an option...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. It is a very effective means of communication to share useful thoughts and perspectives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. Good App if you dont object to how much of your private information they take.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best social media. They keep it chronological. Very high integrity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Manipulated content and trending topics. What\'s the point of using a social media in a environment that\'s editorially controlled by someone\'s opinion? It\'s inorganic, Orwellian and fake. This app is useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accurate Information. I like how I can get accurate news, statements, and information from people that I want to follow, especially government officials like our president, Donald J. Trump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont sensor. Social media is for people ideas right or wrong. Let us decide what is true or false.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. We the people do not need a social media outlet source to censor politic articles for us. We need to be able to read EVERYTHING and  come to our own conclusions. It is not up to Twitter, Facebook or the Media to decide for the people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of Speech. I believe that Twitter underneath the privacy setting that you should explain whatever you want to put on social media to explain the historical facts of what is happening around the Earth. P.S. Please Please Pretty Tweet Please dont fall for that facebook insecurities like Instagram has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Privacy. Twitter makes egregious ABUSE of everyones data. I highly recommend looking at what happened to FaceBook. I recommend completing all details with Anonymous data or COMPROMISE your life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media regulation by government. Too much regulation by the govt will cause the US from innovating and creating freely.   They are successful because of hard work, intelligence, creativity, innovation, motivation, freedom, etc. Minimal regulation acceptable as long as it doesnt take down the success of the business. That would take us backwards. The US wants to remain progressiveI agree with Kevin OLeary on CNBC this morning. Interesting conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter rules. Facebook follows you. Instagram is pictures. Twitter is the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information control. Too much censor. You placed democracy in danger.You also post news which cant be commented on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased Policy. Worlds largest biased social media platform. Good bye..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Twitter is fun, but how much of my data is it selling? Id hate to see it go the same way as Facebook and Google.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App is a joke. Plenty of other good apps out there for news etc. highly invasive of your privacy, they will track you and everything you do and say until the end of time . Selling your information daily . Illegally sharing information .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Educate people in information consumptions. These are the days when fake news spread faster than the facts. Organizations like twitter need to take every possible steps that right messages are reaching to the end users. Have some applications or a team who can help end consumers on authenticity of data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best way to get useful info. Twitter is the best social app out there for those who are interested in getting real time useful information. It's much better than scrolling FB wall which has anything dumped by friend of a friend and their likes and dislikes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your speech and privacy does not matter. Your speech and privacy 100% does not matter in this platform. Dont sell your personal information in social media. They have super power on everything now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. An good app but we inspect more ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOOK AT THE:  DATA LINKED TO YOU AND DATA USED TO TRACK YOU. Enough said.  Dont use this app.  In fact dont use any app whose privacy policy allows it to store essentially all of your personal contacts, photos, videos, addresses, and potentially even record what youre typing or speaking.Thank you Apple for forcing companies to disclose how they monitor their users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doesnt care what we want. Doesnt show my mentions, doesnt show tweets I want to see, no way to control what I see on my timeline (shows me other peoples likes, shows more tweets in in case you missed it etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Communication. Good source of informations and social media. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Organizational Bias. Organizational bias; imposes censorship on news stories. Regulation is needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Be careful of Twitter, your information, pics, phone calls and locations are all in risk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SOCIAL MEDIA NEEDS REGULATIONS. This platform continues to encourage to push its biased agenda, at all costs. Instead of serving as a news source and allowing open-minded views, Twitter has proven to be a biased Silicon Valley company. If you check their Twitter Moments""
Freedom to spread the publics own personal views. Following tweets from around the world gives the general public of the world information which isnt normally seen on tv or heard on radio stations. On many occasions you can get information before its diluted for public viewing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"info Censorship. Used it pretty often to view news and interesting things. Recently it censored a lot of information on Trump, election fraud, etc. Media shouldnt be in the place to judge. Media should not CENSOR information",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mind control app. They just show you what they want you to see. Your app will be filled with fake and oriented news. Its a good example of social media controlled by politicians. Shame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liberal bias rule enforcement. Good content, but like Facebook conservative content gets banned more often based on unverified reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useful, but the team is easily bought. I think the most important thing I look for in social media is to have a safe space for those that cant normally speak out to express themselves, as this helps us all connect a little more. So when staff have gone on record saying they cant ban white supremacists because it would disproportionately affect republicans, I was very shocked. The idea that hateful speech - especially that of which violates their hateful conduct policy - can stick around based on who said it is appalling. We see the US President tweeting and retweeting racist things that are more than just problematic; they incite violence towards people of color, and Twitter staff refuse to hold him accountable. I dont care who it is or how much money these accounts have for Twitters bottom line - to tolerate this for any reason is not okay. I want social media to look out for all its patrons, not just the majority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They sell your information. Too much political propaganda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good Source of Information. This application allows me to follow the people that I want and allows me to receive information that I need for resources. Im not a power user, but it is easy to search and find the information youre looking for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Power of communication. It takes a superior media platform to disseminate public information worldwide. Glad to state without reservation  Twitter got it Informations are building blocks borne by thoughts. They come in different shapes and forms. Theyre either freely accepted or freely rejected but not dissented. Let them stand as they are undeformed. By this information becomes credible in its pure form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My main source of information. Twitter is what you make it. Follow the right people, content, industries, and your newsfeed will not let you down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Like Facebook, your censoring information from people. Stop that and just report the news as is so people can make up their own mind...its out there regardless and by removing or not allowing certain information to be seen, you are aiding in the destruction of the country that has allowed you to become wealthy. Just stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is news feed. It allows me to participate in politics and help shape opinions and reforms in my small way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely bias and not impartial. Social media should be a place where people can express their views and have their friend see those views if they wish to share them. However I have noticed the algorithms in these apps now control what you see and how you share things. Of course things such as hate speech should be removed and deleted but I noticed that racial profiling is a thing and the app actively supports the terrorist state of Israel. They do this by ensuring awareness for the Palestinians are filtered now. They remove posts raising awareness and actively hide them too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What a shame. I just requested a copy of my personal data after having one of the feeds I subscribe to getting blocked even though I opted to receive them while sending me unsolicited ads with hot photos of attractive females who want to travel or marry to a grandpa is ok. The personal data report showed they are storing the locations I have been (based on IP address) what apps I have on my phone and then a list of 50+ interests and pages and pages of what they call Taylored audiences What began by a select few to implement social justice has become a tool for mass manipulation by the very elements who choose to manipulate and brain wash for power and profit.  Twitter you have sunk lower than any of the fascists and dictators I ran away from as a young man with your twisted ideas of mistaking profit with helping people and selectively imposing your twisted narrow view of reality to your subscribers.  I am planning on deleting my account and I hope a system will rise to displace you so people like me can find a voice again without agreeing to sell their souls to you and your advertisers."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good system, no enforcement of rules. It is a nice social media, but its owner does not enforce social rules It is a very offensive and violent environment I barely use it Im here now because I wanted to see some news from my country, but this cyber-space is simply toxic to spend time on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than any other social media app. A great user base. So whatever topic you are interested in you get to hear from the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I dont want to give my phone number so cant get into Twitter no big deal will save my time for another app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Gold Standard of Social Media. Er, thats it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sequestering information from legal U.S. Citizens. Twitter monitors all your activities, locations, posts, and invades your privacy.  Its actually written in the U.S. Whitehouses first page of the introduction paragraphs 3&amp;4.  It clearly states they use third party monitoring to do this to sequester information on Inited States population through third party vendors.  This in turn is a violation of the right to privacy, freedom of speech and many promises made in the Declaration of Independence.  Its its own form it is cyber bullying its own population.  Where as it is supposed to be for monitoring crime and terrorist activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You want FACTS. Great social media vehicle if you are looking for Facts/Truth. If you need to get to the root of a subject in hope of finding the Truth ...start with Twitter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Twitter is a Useful Communication Tool If Used Properly. I began my journey on Social Media on MySpace and now Im on several different platforms. I spend about equal amount of time between Facebook and Twitter. I use FB for local and National issues and politics as well as communicating with friends. Twitter for me is used almost explicitly for expressing my views and opinions about political issues, including local, state and federal matters.Social Media can provide excellent platforms for education, news gathering, entertainment and communication but too often censorship is interfering with free speech which will in time render these useless to the populace.At one time Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc. were all ideas that became realities. Now ideas for new ways to communicate are being explored and coming into fruition with the promise of free expression. If Twitter and Facebook want to stay competitive and remain leaders in this industry my humble opinion is to return to the policies that made your platforms great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information at its best. Information is the best source of history heritage and life keeping people informed is the greatest tool in democracy  gooo twitter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You Restrict Freedom of Speech. Social media is the public square. You restrict speech for specious, disingenuous reasons and you do so most egregiously to restrict views based on your liberal political ideology. And you do so to interfere with elections. You are un-American.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It helps me stay inform of what's happening. I am from Venezuela, but live in Ireland. In my country the government controls all the media. In order to truly know what's going on you have to find it in twitter. Thank you Although it's dangerous that trump has an account and uses it freely :&",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey Twitter,. I was thinking how convenient and easy it would be to keep up w events or things that matter to us that are happening in the world that aren't getting media attentio if we could follow certain hashtags like how insta does it where the hashtag content becomes part of the feed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wow Twitter. I always used Facebook as my main source for information.Now twitter is so much better and more easier to use and read.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. take care of privacy and stop being meddlesome in the political life of the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. Im done with this stupid app. They want to control information. They hate free speech. This isnt what social media is about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. You consistently filter and censor the feed in order to share only the information you wish us to see. Im sick of it. Please stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for current info. Are use Twitter to get up to date information. Its good for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social what?. Is this a social media company or a control your thoughts and voice company? Good thing I only use it to follow specific people and specific advice. Otherwise, Id be manipulated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy NIGHTMARE. Political Company that Accessed Contacts WITHOUT PERMISSION. SHADOW BANNING diverse speech and Opinions that differ from Twitters political ideology.App accessed and SHARED my contacts WITHOUT my permission. Privacy policy a MISLEADING JOKE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best social media platform. Allows us as Athletes & Actors etc. to reach our fan base. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy. I didnt feel safe when im using this app because I dont have the freedom to speech. They could ban me for no reasons whenever they want/assume Im against them, im living in a free country not in China, if theyre doing their business in the U.S, they should respect and follow the law. Imagine that someday you got banned from Twitter just because youre speaking the truth and they dont like that, all they have to do is just close your account and blame you, well thats not the app Im gonna use for sure.Save yourself before they took your freedom away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. It is eye opening how much power companies like twitter and facebook/instagram have. I have deleted my account along with various others to combat this sense of control. They have a monopoly on the market and are using their power to manipulate and censor us and limit our rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Real information. Twitter is great for real live information you can choose what to see and what not to see very secure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Youve already got a valid email, forcing people to provide a phone number or lose their account is ridiculous. If youve got a problem with whats being posted, then target the content, not someone who just doesnt trust you with more info than you need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New path for social media. Social media should be regulated as a public utility. Economic returns should be determined by FTC. Freedom of speech without censorship Social media Barron robbers should follow the old railroad robber Barrons into history.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Honesty. Who owns or data, why is Twitter uneducated after all these years and why left wing ? Weird for a meta product",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One stop information shop. I use Twitter for up to date news, sports scores, road and rail travel information and I communicate with some of my service providers via Twitter too ie Three mobile and my energy supplier. I also like to follow my local police who tweet regularly on the goings on in my area good and bad. I  like the fact I get to see relevant tweets from people and groups I follow as a notification so I rarely open the app as all the info i want is in my phone notification centre. To sum up the Twitter app its my go to place to get the relevant information and news I need, and as I dont follow friends family or z list celebrities I dont get bogged down with all the other stuff that seems to happen on other platforms like Facebook &amp; Instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reliable and informative. What I like is that you can follow only the info that you're interested in instead of all the pointless immature attention seeking that comes with Facebook I'm not much of a tweeter but I enjoy the relevant pics and information tweeted by those I follow ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Media. The new way to look media/pictures of people you follow is horrible I rather use instagram. Sometimes upgrades are for the worst or you hired an old stupid person to be in charge of the application upgrades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media bias. Operators of this social media app should be in jail for the manipulation, political interference and interference with freedom of speech. Cant wait for the government to break up the tyrannical social medias and hold them accountable for their crimes against Americans civil rights",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fund of information. I like the links to articles that enlighten and educate me and the tweets that support my own beliefs.  I try to avoid the naysayers who destroy my faith in humanity.  I now prefer Twitter to Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I dont understand well this social media. I dont understand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and Apple Watch. Please have a paid version which wont gather official or operational PII.

"BIAS. Social media was a place for people from all walks of life and all belief systems to be able to post content that theyd like, as long as it is not pornography, blatant clips of brutal violence, or clear threats, a social media company should not be able to pick and choose opinions and posts they deem as valid and invalid, its a scary time and freedom of speech is clearly no longer free, ask lin wood",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My go to for everything. I use & rely on this app for my news and up to date info, better than FB ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good source of information. If Twitter gets rid of fake news network like the Democratic Party. Gets rid of the Taliban and China hate speechs.  This will be a good place to communicate with friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media in all directions. You can follow all subjects and hobbies. Keep in mind the moderation is pretty unrestricted so there is a lot of inflammatory subject matter and inflammatory people to come with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Political agenda. The system in place that is censoring and locking accounts without a clear reason. Allowing people to submit a report for a tweet that doesnt contain what they reported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Communism at its finest. This app along with Facebook have been bought by the communist there selling our information to China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fairness. The only social media account that I have is  Twitter.  This is how I stay informed.  I love the idea of people being able to share their views, knowledge, expertise etc. however its so disheartening that twitter suppresses conservative news/people.  I was born in a socialist/communist country where people didnt have freedom of speech.  I love the Unites States and am so proud to be a citizen of the greatest country In the world and my heart breaks that platforms like twitter dont realize or see how biased they are towards people who think different than they do.  Truly sad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News. Receiving important news ie traffic information etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Agenda driven. This app is agenda driven by the company. Its all social media lies they want to program you with their beliefs. Twitter is the National Enquirer of social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter. Twitter has become my main source of current news, and indeed, history and literature, beauty and gardening information to mention a few. Not as controlling as FB, it allows me to streamline my feed and create specialized lists so I can avoid the things I am not interested in. I can separate interest groups and commercial contacts, personal and news feeds. FB's tone is patronizing. Pinterest is about impossible perfection. One thing that works with Twitter is the character limit. If I want more detail there are links or other sources. I am glad photos were excluded from the character limit though. Creeps and trolls and smut are dealt with. And the best thing of all is the real-time customer service. If a company I am dealing with is good at Twitter I can get responses and service very quickly. I've had all issues solved to my satisfaction unlike when dealing with letters or email. It is a very public medium and can affect a company's reputation quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. They shut down my account for posting CDC data This is nothing more than a propaganda app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Stores people&#39;s data which leads to hacking Stay Away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. Less regulated than Facebook. Abandon hope all ye who enter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Tool. Social media is technology.  It can be used to with leverage and make your life easier.  However, on the flip slide.. it can do the opposite if you permit it to do so.  But more importantly so, the apps capabilities allows for its users to interact with figures and videos or other content of their choosing and creates a window of new opportunity for learning and perceiving real world news",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"F THE FREE WORLD. Easily the most censored social media platform out there. YOU CAN ONLY SAY THINGS THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA, OTHERWISE YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE BANNED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best. This site is better than Facebook #Facts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter feed from selected follows. I got the app to get information from following certain sites (like a news channel or travel conditions). The only thing I dont like is, I have to maintain a privacy feed to avoid trolls who attack anyone who doesnt agree with their views. The feeds I follow are good but because of the privacy wall I am not able to influence followers except those who I allow which is fine with me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Friends and issues. I find that using social media keeps me in touch with things that are happening. It also keeps me in touch with friends that are on many places.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information advocate. It is not fair to sensor per your own beliefs Nor for financial gain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Informative. Twitter allows me to get information quicker and then discuss that information with people Ive never met to get their views on that subject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Up to date selective news or info. I love following the President, my sports from Australia, and the selected stock gossip. This is my only social media I do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Politics. Dont filter political tweets and accounts just because it doesnt fit twitters agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. Twitter will make sure you see the information you want to see. This platform you have so much potential but now its just a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They sell your information. You will get more spam and junk emails. They are too political Do not download,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Warning. This app will track and collect as much info about you as they can. Twitter also controls what you see and here by filtering anything that doesnt align with their far left views. They banned the president of the United States for telling people to be peaceful but you will find antifa and BLM active and uncensored on here. There is also a lot of pornography.. Stay away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. The optimal social media experience. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. Strongly advised you to avoid apps that require you to surrender so much personal info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than Facebook. It's great to be able to use a app you can look at posts and comment on them freely without a over sensitive staff banning you for honest opinions that others may not like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. I started using Twitter about a year ago as a way to follow all the news channels, virus info and election. Ive been shocked and dismayed to realize over the last 3 months or so just how much info was being censored  This is a social media platform, I feel it is not Twitters responsibility to determine what is true and what is not. Im perfectly capable of researching and making that call for myself. Im switching to an alternative platform by the end of the year in an effort to exercise my free speech rights, as well as make sure Im seeing all stories and opinions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My information hub. I findmy new Twitter account is great for supplying me with information from all sides of every argument or news worthy event.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. I like to Twitter because it give out Great information .  On thing that matter to peoples that in a fight for Life and living,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The opinion gestapo. Twitter, Instagram &amp; Facebook are operated by frauds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPRESSION OF INFO. Too much sensoring of news and too biased,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I dont understand why Twitter pretends to be unbiased then plays internet police. Why cant I view a video or post and decide for myself if the information is legit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Direct information. I like Twitter because it gives you a direct connection to people you respect or value their opinions without having to deal with any bias the media might inject.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love and support fact checking option. I wish every social media platforms add this option and seek fact and truth in every posts and especially those from politicians and popular people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. better social media than Facebooksmooth and simple to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From MikeNasty This Platform Is The best. This site is better than Facebook #FactsFollow Me @realmikenasty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. Like all social media can not be trusted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. Thisll work.  The most intelligent of all forms of social media.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, political favouritism, poor algorithm. As for now, its one of the better platforms for finding good links and information. Mind what you post. They could censor you, shadow ban you, or put you in Twitter jail.People with certain political views are prioritized to be at the top of the comment section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It what is make it. By who you follow. I find its a really direct way to get first hand information, research and views from individuals as well as organisations. Priceless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Filtered information. Twitter is great to understand what you are supposed to think.  They filter out wider perspectives to prevent people from thinking in ways differently from their government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better than Facebook. Social media nothing is private so enjoy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom. I think it is wrong how you can sensor certain accounts on Twitter for sharing things regarding the political ongoings in America, you censor and shadow ban accounts that follow The President regarding certain matters.It also seems that some celebrities and politicians are involved in child trafficking and rituals where they harm innocent children yet you are doing nothing to help apart from banning people that are putting information out there to other people, you automatically place it as fake news without having investigated any of it so it seems to me that Twitter is in fact helping celebrities and politicians by banning accounts that put information out whether it be true or false it should be up to the person reading the information to conclude what they think not have some Twitter expert sat behind a desk hiding information because it could harm a celebrity You seem to support pedophilia and rituals as Ive seen code words from celebrity accounts regarding children YOU PEOPLE ARE SICK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most useful Social Media. Twitter is the go to source for checking my understanding of the days events against others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Corrupt and bias. Censuring. This app is nothing but corrupt. Bias. Unlawful, shadow banning (stop saying you dont. You do). You shut down truth and justice because it doesnt fit your bias and crazy narratives. You censor politics you dont agree with. Likes get removed. You allow mass reporting on accounts over disagreement of views and take sides. At some point this will cost your company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything. It really keeps me up to date whats going on around the world and its a great app to get to know more people a lot better because you can text them as well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They censor information. They censor information and I cant support something that take only shows you what they want you to see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias social media. They filter what you see. They discourage free speech and silence users they dont agree with. I only use this to keep up with fantasy football. Their headlines are misleading and inaccurate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fun but bias. Its fun to communicate with friends and family. But if you want to look at whats happening around the world the app will only give you one side of the story. They force feed you liberal media with the for you feature. Makes me very angry every time I look at the for you page. They also some times feed you one sided news stories with the notifications section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Youre not the social media police. Too much censorship and too little objectivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Its not right that a social media app decides what people can and cant see/post. I understand when it harms others, but they arent a news source. When things go against the views of the twitter ceo, thats when they start censoring. Dont switch up, keep the same energy no matter what.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Censorship. I don\'t like the way you censor and fact check.  Just put the information out there and let your customers do their own research and make up their own minds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. The biggest concern with Twitter is how freedom of speech will get your account banned. Its slowly become the next MySpace and needs to improve much like Reddit or Instagram has in terms of features. Also the political bias of the news articles featured is the reason why I stepped away from it. Not a reliable app at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship is unAmerican. Social Media platforms need review and oversight and should be in compliance with our laws.  You are either a platform for health debate or a publisher.  You cannot be both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typical social media outlet. Exactly what you would expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Concise and to the point. I use it to guide my information on current events and then decide what to expand my mind on later Great resource,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great social media app. They got everything youd need,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quick bits of information when needed. A useful app when you know what youre looking for, be careful not to get sucked into the trolls as with any social media app, thats the downside, I use it mostly for quick news feeds and thats about it lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opinion. Most useful app in social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your app and social media format is trash. Trash that makes you stupid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. IA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Communication purposes and networking. Thanks for inventing instagram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tailored information. Twitter censors too much information thats why I only use Twitter a few times a year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Informative at best and DANGEROUS at most. If youre looking for the best information in the tiniest of crunches, Twitter is the place to go. And Im not talking news feed articles per say. Im talking rich trends that will provide valuable information when you are interested. Plus, the more you use Twitter, the more trends adapt to you. If you talk about politics, itll suggest more politics. Dont want that? Dont talk about politics and ignore the trends, or mark them off saying that you dont want them. If you talk about Ariana Grande, itll recommend Ariana Grande whenever shes trending. Its a pretty helpful app. And when you follow people & topics, theyll pop up on your timeline (or the HOME section of the menu). Now heres the dangerous part. Twitter is known for having NSFW content all over the app, ranging from teens and couples posting previews of their only fans content, NSFW photos & videos about 2D characters all the way to whole PORN companies posting previews of their videos. And it gets even worse from there. Theres occasions where youll see blood & gore, to weird things such as somebody putting their male private part inside a Nutella can, someone sticking a knife up their V (female private part) and...someone...doing things with a rat. That were not going to get into.Is this stuff against Twitter Rules? Some of it, obviously. Twitter allows NSFW 18+ content on their site but if things go too far they take it down. In fact, Twitter has actually decent rules & ban/disable accounts when necessary. The report button is really helpful, but the bot itself will review your tweet & flag it if necessary.Can we block this stuff? Absolutely. You may be retained to 50%+ of what Twitter truly is but if you dont want to see that and only want PG13 Stuff, you should be fine. Automatically, Twitter blocks you from seeing sensitive content on their website upon signing up, so theres no need to manually go into settings to turn it on. The bot manually flags media that could potentially contain sensitive content however people can manually switch that on if theyre feeling nice that day.Overall, Twitter is the most informative yet dangerous social media app on the internet. And once you go in, theres no going out UNLESS you deactivate your account. Be careful, and most importantly, be safe if youre under 18",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Powerful social media. Good platform for general public to express their views about different aspects of their life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. I am not in support of twitter censoring my information.  Let me decide my own opinion about information please,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censuring peoples Opinions. Manipulates peoples ability to access others opinions and news. Manipulates the elections and everything. Engages in policy fixes along with Facebook. Anti democratic social media platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased social media app. I used Twitter to stay in touch with people who had information on the corruption going on in this country, and I never posted anything harmful or against Twitters guidelines. I mainly used the app to like tweets and watch videos, but the same day Trump was banned from Twitter so was I, and since then have been permanently banned from the app. I am blown away by the censorship Jack Dorsey and his team created and allowed to run rampant on this app. For what its worth, the app is useful. It mainly depends on where you stand and what your views are politically as to whether or not you can stay around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Simple but has issues. I like Twitter for its simplicity. It doesnt try to beg for your personal info like Facebook. Its not addictive, for me anyway. Its a neat way to keep up with companies, famous people, and unfiltered information (most of the time).However theres some things that need improved. The app functions pretty good but Ive noticed it can drain the battery too much. If youre on it often expect battery drain. The other thing is the liberal bias. Whether you love or hate the information posted, everyone should have FAIR 1st Amendment rights. Twitter has banned and shadow banned people for having conservative views. Thats fascism Twitter, you keep the servers running and ban those that are truly racist or threats violence. If theyre going on a political rant, leave them alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Users no longer have control over their data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crap policies. The reporting policy is not good enough, so much abusive and discriminatory stuff is on there but the app does not take actions on it.Please make it better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. Due to so much of the mainstream media presenting right wing views and reporting of daily issues in this country Twitter enables me to read the view of ordinary punters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible use of power. As a social media platform you have provided a link to people all over the world the opportunity to share.  You have clearly used your platform for political bias and in fact you have invested very much on the wrong side at that.  This will not play out well for you if you continue to be bias.  Do not forget that you need us the people to consume your product.  If you continue then you will lose the trust of the majority and be beat from your competition and you may have to answer to laws.  Granted your platform is worldwide the United States of America is the worlds biggest consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A great piece of social media. Carefully used by selecting who you are following it is both educative and an outlet for sharing views and opinions. A thick skin is handy and a quick wit. It helps to have a sense of ethics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter. Lets make an app where you can post information about anything, people can respond to your thoughts, and you can just have conversations, unless we dont agree with what someone is saying on there, or it goes against the people who pay us to suppress or put spot lights on information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Responsible Social Media. Loved the Trump tweets health warnings  More of this please ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Filters content at their discretion. They decide what you should and shouldnt see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Davids opinion. Obviously whatever I say has no importance because I never get any retweets or likes. Im completely irrelevant. Someone can and has posted a picture of a moth with a ragged wing and gotten exponentially more response. So this is why I can and do post everything on social media. I actually consider it a virtual diary and dont ever consider than anyone but myself will every read anything I post. The censorship is actually a game with me like a race where I lap my opponents dozens of times but dont get acknowledged the win. I feel like if I hit a 800 yard home run it will be always acknowledged as a ball. Perhaps, honesty in social media would improve it for others. But obviously, Facebook is such a joke it has to change its name and it total garbage. Neat that Twitter allows such interconnection and basically creates a website for each post. Functionally brilliant and definitely the heartbeat of the World. The best bar none. But obviously how gives the slightest care about anything I say or think. That is the game right? To turn Seabiscuit into a plow horse and Michael Jorden into the janitor right..?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Until yall have privacy settings for who can see my liked tweets and such yall are pointless to use.I have a lot of nsfw I follow, and sadly a lot of people follow me. None of which need to be able to see what Im into.Lack of privacy keeps me from using your app. Fix it so I can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fast and easy to retrieve information. I trade Foreign currencies and derivatives. With Twitter, I can have all the news from my financial websites feed to Twitter. So, I can learn of any pertinent trading news at  a centralized location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring people. They want to censor your posts. You can say hateful comments if it fits there agenda but say something they dont like and they can ban you. Plus they sell your information so you are paying for it by giving them the right to sell you personal info. Its like buying a car from a dealership and they dont like the way you drive it so they take it back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feed and Interests. The feed doesnt display all tweets or in chronological order. They took away the relevant topics to follow for me and keep trying to push celebrity feeds and nothing else. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and privacy issues. Censorship and privacy issues are my main concerns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good for Self-Promotion. If I want to tweet out a new video, stream, or a bit of news of things to come, its fine. Its another social media platform to promote my stuff. But its like throwing things into tether of social media in the twitter side of things. Very rarely a tweet of mine gets one reply or one heart. Never any RTs. I dont even know if its seen or not. Or searched for. Where are those stats?Maybe thats because Im hardly on. Im busy as a new parent. I dont follow the right people or anyone really. Im not doing the follow-for-follow. I have no real friends on twitter who care what I tweet and share. Everyone I do follow only cares about what they tweet or what the bigger celebrity they follow.I would only use it if I feel the need to do a tweet blast of something going on with me. But those are far and in between. I got to want to do twitter blasts of my days and my life. And often, I dont.I do see twitter being useful if it sent me notifications or actual news I care about. Or the people I follow post things I want to open the app to see. But I havent curated my follows and alerts to that yet because Im too busy on other apps that do it better. I like seeing photos of Pok茅mon, action figure, games, and old computers. But going to instagram, I get that easy. It is already curated through my likes. I usually get good news I care about from a Facebook post just a second after I open the app and swipe down a couple of times.I keep twitter because maybe there is something I want to share or promote. Maybe RT something my one friend posted. But thats it. Twitter is bottom of the barrel for my social media needs and usefulness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why is this happening?. Why does twitter want your personal info? I got locked out of my account for doing something that violates the rules but I didnt do anything but check my feed. Honestly I thought Twitter was gonna be a good app, turns out that they want your personal information for something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To regulated. You filter the things you shouldnt and dont filter the things you should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Politically Motivated. Worst ever social media plateform. They think they can restrict you from posting. F. UC. K you n get out of my phone. Deleted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage. This is the worst social media app. They censor opinions they dont like. They hate the facts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. If you didnt censor and throttle down Peoples opinions and facts.  You could potentially have a decent product.  As it is. Its maybe a once a day check to see what some people say. But I have to go look for them because you censor or throttle them down so their tweets dont reach people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensor. I enjoy who I follow and check it here and there but as a whole I dont like that Twitter is allowed to sensor ANYONE We choose who we follow and if we dont agree with or relate too or even just dislike them we dont need to follow them.  It irks me that you sensor ANYONE.  I hope in the future the government finds a way to stop all media platforms from this practice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Handling violence and abuse on social media. Great job on putting a check on Trump. People do not understand the difference between the right to freedom of speech and turning that right into abuse. Not everyone is educated. Not every one cares. I understand that the line is extremely thin and complicated. But if you own a social media platform, it is your prime responsibility to monitor these vagabonds and deal with them firmly today to prevent an irreparable and scarring damage tomorrow. The price we pay today to achieve that is nothing compared to the price we may pay with our lives tomorrow. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter for true and fair information. I started using Twitter because, Twitter, avoided lie and violence.I believe, this social media, should be used for true and fair comments and information only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LISTS. I follow a lot of people and its hard to keep up with everything I see on my feed. On Instagram, I would have to create multiple accounts to follow people to have my feeds more organised. On Twitter in the other hand, I dont need to do that as there are lists. Lists are feeds where you are able to add profiles onto it and all their tweets will appear in that list. Its like creating a separate feed and choosing what you see in it. Its the best way to organise what you see on social media and I am in love with it. I have a music feed where I chose to add artists I love in there and I can just go there anytime to see whats going on in their world, and then I have another list for Films. Its great and this one feature alone made me give this app 5 stars. Twitter has everything else that all other social media have, but even more features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENSORSHIP. If you want censored or if you want biased information then Twitter is for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seems to take me where it wants and not where I want. Everyday it would show me things I wasnt interested in and didnt put forward things from the people or business I was following even though when I checked their accounts they had tweeted.  Too many offensive sex ads and tweets from foreign countries in languages I cannot read.  I am done with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Too much censorship of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, election meddling, sells your info. If you dont care about your info go with twitter. It sells your info, censors free speech and meddles in elections by filtering conservative speech and promoting liberal lies. Wouldnt surprise me if its actually owned by China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lackluster Security and Poor Monitoring. Trying to find a social media site that actually monitors content of users to prevent abuse and misinformation. This aint it. Work harder to be neutral and apply the same rules to celebrities as average citizens. Right now its as bad as Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Private Opinion. Without question one of the most biased social media platforms available. It is a matter of fact, you have proven your outlet to be a publisher not a platform for open opinion and conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meh. Not freedom of speech friendly.   Banning and/or promoting users based on their political views, or religious views.  Double standards for individuals based on their ethnicity, skin color, Social Status, or Political affiliations. Not a very fair interface for the everyday individual; but I dont mind a challenge. I just use it for laughs because other than that its absolutely unreliable. Sometimes, I find interesting information or informative news, but mostly its fake news and outrage.   Every now and then the application can help me to get current events before anyone else however it is very subjective; you have to know how to efficiently and effectively employ discernment, AND youll need your since of humor.  I guess a very high percentage of the user base is solely interested in the goings on of Celebrities, so thats usually what you find trending, you have to really search and sift through the garbage to find anything useful.   Twitter seems to have a very off balance TOS.  One part of it seems to be unspoken while the other is the actual EULA.   Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter Rules. Twitter and Facebook are the best social media you can use everyday. You get what youre looking for instantly without wasting precious time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. This is the only Social Network that I access for News. Along with my favorite celebrities and Favorite lesbians,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Let people say what they want.If others do not choose to research the facts. So be itIts not Twitters responsibility to verify everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its the filter you need. Choosing what I read: enjoying the selectivity of news sources and info Would still like to see better aggregation by followed person for a better view of what theyve tweeting and liking etc. thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I made an acc to just follow some people and I told it not to notify anyone about it next thing I know it notifies everyone in my contacts... lame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. You censor people and only add the information you wish, your a means to an end thats it. Horrible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Concern. Please dedicate more resources to combat disinformation on your platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Way better than FB. This is the place to go if you want up-to-date news on events or what\'s happening in the world. With some minor improvements this will be the future of social media.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Info at a glance. Quick & easy platform to keep current on anything from whats going on in the world, to whats going on in someones head & everything in between according to whos tweets you choose to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News, Education, and Social Media all-in-one. I use Twitter now 10X more then Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook. I dont know how you live without it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Limits Freedom of Speech. Sad to see social media apps play politics. They shouldnt take away rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agendas. What a terrible app. One of the most toxic places on the internet. And they still manage to ban thousands of accounts usually for conservative content. For instance I was telling an individual who thought the more important takeaway of the Chad Wheeler scenario was that Kaepernick got bad media attention, that this is was a disservice to anyone who actually suffered from domestic violence and that its not racial or political the man committed a crime and deserves to rot in prison. I was banned for this. So yeah Twitters wack and clearly wants people to be divided and not think clearly.My reviews keep getting deleted, but also they locked my other account for suspicious activity and I dont even use it, they just want your phone number to unlock everything. Big surprise there. A massive corporation wants to collect more data on you. Right to privacy where you at",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i look at my feed like its the newspaper. no problems w the app. by far my favorite social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased Policy Enforcement. Pretty clear that Twitter selectively enforces policy based on political affiliations, not to mention shadow banning and other backend tools used for censoring speech.Also, new conversation view has broken the app for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Viewing content. This social platform has become too controlled by other outside sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media is designed to divide the world and exploit our weaknesses. Jack Dorsey has used his platform to gamify humanity just as badly as Zuckerberg has used his platforms to harm democracy and human progress. What we see here are sociopath charlatan CEOs and their investors ruining our lives, using data from our conversations to front run us and manipulate trends so they can warp our minds and extract more and more wealth from our pockets. Theres no social about social media. Its deeply unsocial and anti-social.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Media to Info Pedia. Twitter is the greatest tool to not only network and interact with a huge range of individuals sharing every type of content whether it's jokes, official statements, infographics, live updates to the most random things to the most insightful. I'm an early adopter and active user of Twitter, the app has never really given me problems though after years of constant use know where and what Twitter can improve, add and work on for a better experience, interface, improve user engagement and retention et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Twitter List. So far ?So goodImprovements are necessary though Better policing of malicious and pornographic content (It DOES slip through in spite of current efforts)Can also include violent and sexually explicit content tooTwitter needs to have two different platforms One for social content One for business/commercial And each must have their own set of security and form content regulations I realize this will smacks of censorship to many:However the deliberate attempts to harmPeople that disagree wit others OrWho are different?Should never be allowed on a public information highway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To much power. Twitter is supposed to be an information APP, not a God-like purveyor of right and wrong. They control information like Google, Facebook, Apple and many others but what makes them qualified or even justified to determine what information I should see or not see. You provide. Ill decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most dependable social media. I love Twitter where I get to express my views and like my followers postings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. If u would like a social media platform where free speech is allowed and you can express whats on your mind. This aint it. If you like group think and censorship of information. This is the platform for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GOD. HI FRIEND, WANTED TO GIVE YOU ONE OF MY NEW PRODUCTS. SO HERE IT IS CALLED: HOW TO WRITE ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. ONLY THE BEST WRITERS WRITE IN COMMENTS POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THAT IS THE LAW. IF YOU NOTICE SOMETHING WRONG ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased and censored. Tired of media taking sides. I want all the information uncensored without Twitter manipulating what is \Trending\. As bad as Facebook now."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy settings. You have directed me to a page that says you are required to tell me that you trackMy locationContactsBrowsing historyPurchasesAnything I read online or do online, due to some new rule that says, you have to tell people how you track their every keystrokeOkay, thanks for telling me. Now do I have to just stop using Twitter, because it is the novel, 1984, incarnate, or can you place an Opt Out option somewhere on one of these pages of information you showed me?Each page I read said, just go to account settings, or PrivacyNone of the pages I was directed to gave me an option to Opt Out of any of this tracking.Thanks for the information; it was really enlightening. Please give me an Opt Out Tracking option where I can easily see itOtherwise, Im out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for public information. My personal view is Twitter used responsibly is great for bringing information to the wider pubic that otherwise would not be seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media is what it is. You know the dill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Unacceptable censorship occurring for no reason other than political gain. Go to Parler or Gab for unbiased social media.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yuck. They want to control information. They hate free speech. This isnt what social media is about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My go to communication app. This app is therapeutic in that it allows me to voice my options and to catch up on all that is happening out in the world. I find that Facebook has more blow back from friends and family when I post something that goes against the grain of their opinions. They are both toxic, however you grandma is usually on Twitter to see sometimes off color posts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fact checking. Best social media especially after the new tool of fact checking the POTUS. Way to go. Please always support truth. Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bias Practices. This company practices bias against their App users, in many cases violating freedom of speech rights while ignoring the tweets of users aligned with the developers own political and social beliefs that violate the companys own rules while suspending temporarily or permanently to usage of account users who do not agree with the developers beliefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased Social Media. The app is biased when it comes to politics. You cant speak your views without being banned, unless you share the same views as Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bullsh*^ with its stupid way of controlling what you say. Them and Facebook are the worst companies in the world, I cant say what I want because it interferes with their guidelines, They can control the World, but they cant control me, So I dont use there stupidly pathetic app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. If you want to see filtered biased media, this is the place to go. They ban you for having a different view on anything. They started with banning those who violated TOS. But then moved on to people who had no posts and no followers but banned them for following people like the president. The worst app for social media I have ever seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No Privacy. Theres kind of no privacy on this app. At all. I would like to control what pops up on peoples timelines. I dont understand why replies from tweets that dont apply to people who follow you have to show up in the timeline. I would like to have conversations and input detailed opinion without it filling up my friends timelines, and o dont want other peoples replies filling up mine. I think it should be fixed. Also you should tighten your policy on nude and graphic images. Ive seen nude images get 1,000 likes on twitter in the replies and nothing is done about it. It should be handled quicker. I dont want breasts popping up on my screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. After someone post my sex life and personal email too my work Twitter page and Twitter will not take the post down I have to delete my Twitter.. Twitter will protect the abuser and stand behind your attacker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Easier to use. I like the improvements done to this app, especially the live feed view and the proactive review of abusive/harmful tweets. That said, recommend changing Fact check to a more neutral category similar to Wikipedia when a current event has disputed contentious or developing information, and an advisory is placed stating such",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political App. This is not a social media app governed by the laws of the US. It has a political agenda and should be governed by those laws.Expect racist and fascist posts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Best source of information. Following the correct personal, weather and so much more You can stay on top of the information happening around the world, and your own home town, from state Congressional people .Twitter can keep you updated on just about everything,very Happy using Twitter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. I cannot wait until another social media comes out. So tired of the censoring and bias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shadow Banning. Hundreds of people hired on to view your private pictures ... especially the naked pics.  Everything you do, say or even delete is saved on these individuals private servers and computers. Twitter turns around and sells your data. Twitter employees brag about all of this. Look it up Think twice before you climb into bed with the folks at Twitter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good system, no enforcement of rules. It is a nice social media, but its owner does not enforce social rules It is a very offensive and violent environment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Corruption and Censorship. Fully utilizes censorship to hide facts from Americans that just want a fair and honest resource.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good source of information. But as with anything in the internet, you have to take some time to filter out the noise. Once youre past that period, your feed becomes more enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app does the job. This app allows direct sourcing of vast numbers of newsmakers in diverse fields to understand the information that is import to you. This is a mature app for mature thinkers. You must connect the dots for your self to build a global picture. The strength in this is the only bias you must deal with is your own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Best social media. The best social media with AI supported , they can detect the knowledge and experience of the response and placed your response accordingly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social distancing. Best media ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Twitter sells your personal information then turns around and rewards you by banning you when your opinion isnt lockstep with theirs.  They need to understand the US Constitution and stop trying to be China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete this app. They use your information without your permission. Theres zero freedom of speech. Twitter and Facebook days are nearing the end. Hope these platforms fall hard. Maybe the new generation will learn from their biased mistakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Promotes Censoring Opinions. Big Tech that will only allow certain ideas, opinions and beliefs to be posted. Censors anything that does no go along with the liberal media. Also promotes fake news.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. The most biased platform in social media.  Shameful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An essential. I have been using twitter since 2011, and I would not give it up. No nothing bad to say about it. I like it more than ig, or snapchat, or even Facebook because it\'s mostly about opinions or thoughts. Also, you only \heard\ opinions of those whom you follow""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political Sensorship. Doesnt that say it all. Any app that allows political sensorship should not be allowed to exist in this country. I have deactivated my account as well as many of my friends and family and I will be encouraging others to do so as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. While not as strict as Facebook, people are still getting banned and blocked for dumb reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best access to direct information. I use Twitter daily to see news updates that Im concerned about. #Bitcoin to the moon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Content not available. Why do you sensor political posts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TWITTER HAS ONLY ONE TWERP. Well, yes I rate Twitter highest of all of the Apps for Social Media, as long as it meets my needs to communicate and to-be-in-the-know-of-TRUTH.  Actually, I enjoy all interconnectivity to &amp; from Twitter to import &amp; export TRUTH, otherwise its cumbersome to research and analyze for actual Fact-Based articles, notifications and current events or authentic NEWS  Twitter meets my personal and professional needs for the aforementioned reasons, basically a Research Engine that really works well for me I have but one concern and possibly its because of my own ignorance. That is the number of Followers and Following, itself Im being limited to 5,000 and cant seem to follow back unless others drop me or I frequently cull the herd to add them I actually prefer to follow back but, cant until I investigate in a 5,000  F-to F-ratio individually by FOLLOWERSAm I managing a certain amount of each of the two categories ?  Am I restricted for any reason unique to my style, politics, or processing of this measurement (or system) to keep us ALL on a network load control?  If so, how am I doing and will I ever get to forget about this 5,000 Limitation ?  Why am I having to work at this so often?  If this is the way it is, Id like to know which of mine are mere Listeners or better said might be Readers  for it is those Id unfollow, especially if I had a photographic (or eidetic) memory or more information about which ones do this to my allowance or maximum.  Then Id ask why do I have a maximum number to manage?Thank you for asking, because everything else works for me, far beyond expectations and other SM procedural standards for my needs. Susan Re Cupcakes on Twitter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good platform/ Bad censorship. Information that is not violent or illegal should not be censored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like using Twitter. I like using Twitter. I have some control on the information I am interested in and want to share with others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Politics. TOO MUCH POLITICS I only like it for sports and business but its turning into FACEBOOK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Big Brother. Im seeing a lot of Orwells 1984 here.  Your vetting algorithms are left leaning.  Your question should be, does a social media platform have an obligation to protect anyone?  And, if so, who from what?  This presupposes the who and what are homogeneous.  America by its very nature is homogeneous only by its adherence to our foundational laws - the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  So, if youre circumventing these for a business ideology with a foundation in political ends youre doing Americans an injustice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Using Twitter. Its good to keep up with info and friends. I love seeing and sharing information daily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. So much inaccurate information being tossed about. No attempt to have legitimacy of the twitter holder. Lot of nonsense. Media posting unreliable information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congratulations for being data ... hookers. This was the only social media account I owned as the privacy and ads werent nearly as bad as the others. However with the new changes regarding my ability (or lack thereof) to change how much is allowed I have deleted the app. Well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Epic social app with pros and cons. This is a great app and way to communicate information. The ability to follow leaders in our community as well as friends or businesses that you feel are important is great. The downside is people believe everything they read. As we all know, there are exaggerations, things said are taken out of context, and out right lies are sometimes shared. People need to use a bit more scrutiny and common sense when using apps like this. Facebook, Instagram and other apps are just the same way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Safe,Friendly, Fun. This app feels so much more secure and fun than Facebook and Instagram. The constant conversation and hop topics of society keep millineals  entertained. The group of people that Ive met on this app have been so supportive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suppression. People have the right to hear all information from both sides and then decide for themselves. Right or wrong. Nobody can control what i want to pay attention to. Twitter goes to far with suppressing information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Monitor accounts for illegal activities. Twitter doesnt not track what is being posted on their app at all, Ive seen people posting highly illegal content and Ive have reported hundreds of accounts to get them taken off the site for I even had one of my accounts banned because I had reported so many accounts but I wouldnt have to if they monitored content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political Bias, but theres funny memes. If you want to allow political opinions to be shared on your app, its all or nothing. You dont get to cherry pick and suppress certain views and promote another. Nazi Germany and other terrible regimes accomplished terrible things because they were able to control their respective populous by similar means. Maybe it wasnt your intention to fall victim to greed and lust for power, to have your pockets filled and egos stroked by those who would control you and the general public through you, but you may still have the power to prove otherwise. Will you use it though? Will you make a truly transparent media site, and allow people the opportunity to decide what they think and find out what is truth and what is lies for themselves? Or will you continue to control them by suppressing certain views and deciding what the truth is yourself  or rather what the truth that most benefits particular peoples interest is? Economically the choice is clear, but its on you to make this an ethical choice. You know ethics, in case you forgot its about doing the right thing even when no one is watching. The meme pages are funny though lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STOP CENSORSHIP. We will find a way to get the info out. STOP CENSORING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Networking is a key skill in our field. As the title says it all, however Ill elaborate and emphasize that social media, specifically network is becoming bigger in our field (science). I used to just have an account for fun to look at jokes and what not, but I use it professionally to keep in contact with people whom I havent even met half of them, to network and collaborate in science. Thanks, Twitter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great source of info. Once you cut through the noise, Twitter has a wealth of knowledge to offer via access to some of the smartest people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its Twitter. Basically all the people you follow are people you dont know IRL but would like to be your friends. Where FB is all the people you know and wish you didnt.News is real-time and usually you know things long before it hits the TV or MSM. Doesnt cost anything, and great for finding groups of common interests while being anonymous. Heavily political, but blocking and muting is easy Great for different viewpoints, but also includes a bunch of Ill informed saps. Super easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Communication. We need uncensored news .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bias. Biased just like every other major social media corp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. You are a biased social media outlet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What social media should be. This app has become a left wing/globalist hub. Twitter states it supports free speech yet they censor anything that doesnt support their views or those of who are paying for their services. How facist of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal Agenda. This App has its own political agenda.  I censors opinions.  Do not suppress.  Im off Twitter  Dont support their control to opinion censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. You dont care about freedom of speech or the freedom of expression and thought. It is such a shame. This will all crash and you and Facebook will be gone without the freedom of speech and freedom of expression and thought be careful what you wish for. I will pray for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. Like all social media can not be trusted.to hard to navigate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"best social media app. Keep up with your favorite celebrities, athletes, journalist etc. just wish i was verified already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. Knowledge is power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should stop ALL CENSORSHIP. Should embed instagram images. Should  connect to facebook feed like instagram. Should stop ALL CENSORSHIPCant wait until people can sue you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Policies and laws. Twitter is one of my favourite apps for sure, however, recently weve discovered that twitter MENA to be specific is biased and not fair. It applies policies and laws to some people and some not - even if reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Task and faster than any other social media. Love how you can get answers and get to the latest event or issues in the area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National security. It has come to my attention for having Twitter in so many other countries that people are using it to spy on other people in other countries as well as sexually and generally nauseating people making money off of sexual exploitation it is a cause for concern and health as far as national security issues it is definitely a problem people hacking and getting credit for doing it to multiple accounts as well as political figures and finding any information on them at that moment in time while on Twitter I dont like it and it wont boat well for the overall status and protection of one another stay safe and may god bless each and ever single person on this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lovin Twit. Recently I have discovered twitter for news and information and love that I can easily customize and quickly access whats relevant to me I get why there is a limit now. It makes sense to get your info and go. Keep up the good work and congratulations on becoming profitable, it was only a matter of time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media. It's twitter, it does exactly what we expect twitter to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased media. Id like this a lot if wasnt so liberal biased like Facebook liberals can cuss out and threaten the POTUS and fellow conservative, but when the conservatives fight back , they get their accounts suspended or deleted by the liberal admin. I wish it was more balanced. Food for thought admins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Must read. This SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLET HAS BEEN CHANGED TO INFESTED WITH BIASED AGENDA GARBAGE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Takes responsibility and fact check people, unlike FB. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News and Network. I go to Twitter for news. A huge variety there. And events are reported quickly. Also, networking with people on a variety of interests is invaluable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great way to use social. Quick. It forces you to get to the point and doesnt have the whole hassle of garbage algorithms that keep you from getting to your audience on other social media platforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only social media I use. I got tired of Facebook and Instagram. Twitter is  better and I choose who I can see or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great. I have been using Twitter for six years and feel it is a great resource to push out info or obtain info, whether personal or business. I only wish you offered an additional selection besides like. Facebook gives people a few more emotion options.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My main source of information. Twitter now has replaced emails as my main source of information about various subjects of interest to me.Reliable, easy to use and I find myself following  and connecting with more peoples each week.Advertisement section seems appropriate and I dont mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sold out platform. For years i used to think social media is the only platform which channels your thoughts, ideas, opinions and values transparently. Now that my eyes were opened and am able to realise that it can be controlled by industry heads and politicians. Such a shame to bend yourself before influential people and backstabbing the users of it.Twitter involving in mass suspension of about 400 twitter handles belonging to a particular follower group for the reason that they are protesting against the government order to allow uranium mining in forest area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The policy and political moves of Twitter. I dont like the way social media app involved in politics by blocking presidents accounts or block them from tweeting simply u r an app u should not be involved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information suppression. Im off to Parler because Im sick off your political bias and auditing of truth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A real source of information. Twitter has greatly enhanced our ability to share knowledge continuously. Freedom of expression and freedom of sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My News Source. When it comes to breaking news - Twitter Its my app to aggregate news and follow the news makers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App censors. Social media should be open to all peaceful opinions and matters.  Let freedom ring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great information. Love all my political contacts and news related feeds. Let\'s you filter between real news and lies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. You guys need to just open the flood gates. I believe social media is a pressure valve, and censorship only plugs the valve and increases the pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased opinions. Taking away freedom of speech. My account was deleted for sharing my political opinions. I have seen multiple occasions where one political party is being deleted for sharing their opinions. This app is very biased. In America I have a freedom of speech. I have a freedom to my own opinions. I have a freedom to say exactly how I feel. Yet one political party continues to be deleted for simply sharing their views. I will no longer be using this app,  nor would I recommend it to anyone else. They will censor everything you see or post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liberal filter. Much like Facebook, Twitter will filter any rational, conscious, or common-sense information and inundate you with Liberal nonsense. If that wasnt bad enough, they will shadow-ban and unfriend conservative news outlets without your say so. This app is disgusting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mostly factual. Great to read the majority of information is factual. Not like other social media platFBforms....oops. Typo ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amplify Trusted Nurses and Researchers. @Twitter facilitates networking and the ability to disseminate evidence-based information between groups providing trusted content for #PublicHealth and #policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
censorship. fascism at its finest. censoring your opposition and twitter is doing it at will. deleting facebook and instagram too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useless. How is this app still relevant? It limits your character count unless youre a celebrity...double standard much? Also, it allows for violations of its own policies IF youre the president.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a waste of time. Social media is evil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Censorship and miss information is the way Twitter runs their app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best Social Media App hands down. You know its true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waste of time and intrusive. Allows you to make an account and use it for a day, but then blocks you from doing anything until you give them your phone number. Another scummy tactic for your data from big tech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Profit seeking company. People who i do not follow now come on my feed. Why? Profit - why else If they dont fix it i will stop using this source of social media.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter rules, when it works. Odd that Twitter wanted me to review the app the day after a major outage that kept me from being able to use the service for hours. But, in general, this is my favorite social network Its not trying to undermine our democracy or anything similar. Instead, if you follow the right people, it is one of the best news services on the planet. Honest And that remains true whether you are interesting in food, the stock market, weather or politics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unlawful & Unfair Censorship. Youre a social media platform. You have no right to target &amp; censor those whose opinions you do not like. When you do that &amp; fact check you then become an editorial entity &amp; should legally be dealt with accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Socialize social media. Private ownership off the taxpayer-developed Internet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much better than Facebook. Its addictuve, i can keep up with the news, sports and many other things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Phone number policy problem. ok so first I wanna start of by saying your security is getting very bad, people cant make new accounts with the new policy. What if someone doesnt have a phone number? I dont wanna have to put my phone number when I make an account. An email is okay but phone numbers are private, they shouldnt be involved in making an account. You need to change it back to what it was before. No phone number policy. I wont be using or recommending Twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Greatest social media platform going. Live using it every day and getting info I need and want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Twitter is a platform that does not allow free speech . Its more worthless than Facebook . At least on Facebook you can store pictures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. The censor certain groups and minorities. Check out other social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter is a fabulous source for acquiring information about everything and anything. Twitter is a good source of information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter. Very good for getting information from people in the know.However, it needs to be regulated to end its censorship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instagram Snapchat Facebook wayyy better. The Help Center is terrible. No way to communicate with them all at. If youre away from your account for a long time they will suspend it like they did with me. Then they will error code you infinite amount of times. I would of thought a billion dollar social media outlet would be better than that in 2021. Good luck to everyone who has it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Magic. The opportunity to get information straight from the newsmakers is magic, a miracle. The opportunity to communication with them and each other is equally valuable. The bias of the mainstream media is muffled by Twitter. Fabulous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Controlled content. Twitter blocks content it deems unwanted such as the Palestinian cause for Sheikh Jarrah. Whats the point of social media if our posts are going to be blocked and restricted? Wheres the freedom of speech?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RIP FREEDOM PS SPEECH. The fact that a social media company can sensor the potus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"N@zis. Twitter along with the other major social media platforms (not a platform because it dictates what you can say.  Attacking only Libertarian/Conservative ideologies). If youre fall heavy left on the political spectrum, this app is for you.  They ban anyone who bashes the government and take down posts/comments of anything that tells the truth and hurts your feelings.  Banned the 45th President of the United States, so thats another plus for this apps cultist followers.  Ive had two accounts banned for sharing factual news because twitter fact checker gets to dictate whats true and whats not true.  Love free speech?  Twitter isnt the place for you.  Now, Twitter is making a new and ingenious rule to ban anyone and delete posts from anyone that includes picture/video/audio of anyone who didnt consent to it.  Which would clearly make sense in cases like naked photos/sex videos, underage, etc.  but this is targeted towards Project Veritas who has on countless occasions, released video/audio of leftists being corrupt (Twitter being a few of these occasions).  This is to include anyone else who basically whistleblows.  They say history repeats itself, and I definitely believe it.  Major social media platforms are laying the grounds to a new N@zi regime.To end this, get GETTR.  A social media platform where you dont have to worry about a bunch of N@zis pushing a agenda",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best thing since sliced bread. It truly is the best social media app out there. It allows you to view posts that are of current events rather than of the last mirror selfie of someone. It gives you up to date (by the moment it happens) information about the things you are interested in. The algorithm is works so well and doesnt seem annoying or invasive because it sends provides information that is actually interesting and make you feel like you learned something new each time you log on. I will never regret downloading the app and making an account... even if I only ever have 3 followers because followers is not what its about with the is app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. Twitter allows you to speak your mind unlock Facebook. It protects our rights on freedom of speech and give us a platform what the media wont show.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensor and. People dont like to be censoredJust because you disagree with their politics. Everyone should have the right to express their opinions and how they feel about some thing.I have seen a Twitter ban things you disagree with and allow some pretty disgusting threatening tweets So Im not as much of a fan of Twitter as I used to be and I have switched over to some other platforms that I will be using.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invasion of privacy. Not only do they have actress to our email and our information and contentious tracking of our phones they want to know where we are. At all time /:/:::: this is BS on a massive scale at what point do we say enough is enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Need more social platforms. Need more choices in electronic socialization. Tweeter seems to be regulating  information, which is in direct conflict of a free society.  If one can stand on any street corner in America and speak his mind freely, that same person should and must be allowed to put it on a screen and press send. Anything less than free and open conversation is robbing basic freedoms from the citizens.  Once a company begins to sensor information, thoughts and people,  that company should be regulated by the masses and held liable for information they do allow to be posted that cause a harm to anyone or anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. I use it more than Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. Great information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Communism. When you only censor one side of politics in America that is communism (socialism with some extra umph). Last I checked we lived in a free country with free speech. Way too much censoring based off of Twitters biased personal beliefs. Completely the opposite of the supposed idea behind Twitter. Deleted the app and will never use it again. Ill be shocked if Twitter keeps this accurate and honest review around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Infringes of free speech. Not hate speech... free speech. Just like Facebook they are filtering what is acceptable or facts. Allowing liberal/socialism, hate for America, and any other groups such as Antifa to exists... if your a conservative you are the enemy of Facebook and instagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Garbage, never worth it. They track and steal information. They refuse to let me turn off personalized ads, tracking my data across multiple websites despite the fact that Ive turned it off in my settings and my twitter settings. Its disgusting and disgraceful and if I can find a way to sue you bet I will",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely disgusting. social media is a place to discuss your personal life, there should be no rules. you banned the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES because you were afraid he was going to expose the democratic party aka people who run this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter sensors free speech. Great outlet for sports news. Twitter is bias and pushes a politically left agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Controlling Social Media. I find that Twitter allows me to stay in my zone, under my control, yet with the freedom to venture into new fields.  All this without massive advertising, that crushes real content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Left wing propaganda. This app is overtly and outwardly left wing propaganda. Along with Facebook, Twitter has lost all credibility when it starts to use its so called fact checkers to prevent people from sharing posts that are damaging to the Democratic Party. No one knows who these fact checkers are or how they are being funded. Get off this app while you still can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Informed. We can talk to the people that keep us informed... on everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordo ap chao. Our president tweets a lot I took the world with Facebook. However Facebook is now restricting accounts beyond reason. Twitter offers a semi professional communications network with the world arena. Linked in tends to censor anything that goes against an agenda much like Facebook. Freedom of the press is necessary to ensure the freedom of all loving hearts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. No, I dont enjoy that at all I will look elsewhere for my information as half the Country is doing as well. You got a little too big for your own britches Not good when you piss off half your customers. As Big Tech you think you would have anticipated this. Uh oh. No info is better than censored info",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Policys. They enforce there policys when its convenient for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst social media app. Not sure why anyone would use this while Instagram and Facebook exist. They also dont allow you to remove your email or phone number from your profile. Twitter is awful all around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Enjoying Twitter. There is totally a learning curve with figuring out how to post and use the app. I dont quite understand how the newsfeed wks, it seems to jump and not be consecutive in dates.  While I respect peoples opinion on an open platform I dont think it is ethical to censor for political gain America first ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its lack of management. Full of Fake accounts, nude photos, porn photos. Its worst than Facebook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good news app. As a platform it could be better against false flagging. As an app, it has everything you need for the site in an easy to access way. I only wish as a new user, there was a bit more of a guide to using it all. Given I don't personally use social media sites, didn't know the whole hashtag thing sort of started here. But it's fun when projecting a personality and keeping in touch with mutuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. Sensors everything that doesnt follow their beliefs. We have the right and freedom to know the truth. Media should not be able to control what we should belief its our right to do that . All they should is just display the truth as it comes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News and Information in Real Time. I enjoy reading the feed and obtaining information and real news in real time and the varied reaction to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Informational and entertaining. Its a great app to keep current on whats socially and politically happening in my environment. Its also become a great source to keep updated with black twitter and pop culture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customise privacy settings please. Used this app for 10 years and the functionality is almost perfect. The only thing I would like is customisable private accounts like Facebook has. In general Id like my tweets private but when I @ a company or someone who doesnt follow me they should be able to see it. Especially as twitter is the main method of communication with brands now. Just a simple option to make certain posts public to the people tagged in them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political bias. Censorship and political bias makes this social media app terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharing Your Private Information To God Knows Who. Dont Want Companies Having My Information I dont Want Compaines that I dont Deal with To Have My Information I dont want TWITTER To Sell My Information With Everything Going On This Is The Last Thing I Need To Deal With I Also Think Other People Feel The Same WAY Its Bad Enough That Cops Follow YOU Instead Of Selling Users Information to Third and Second Parties Help the Blind and help the People that cant hear as well  Again I say I Opt-Out of Having Twitter Sell My Information ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its free. Better than Facebook. Great way to keep in touch with daily news and events. Keeps one in the know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Severely politically biased platform. Twitter constantly pushes left narratives that pushes their agenda. Its disgusting and they promote racial divide in our society. They just recently put in their news category that recent videos leaked of Joe Biden in 1985 was out of context yet not ONCE did they ever publish or promote tweets of fact checks that debunk the people who wrote fake news on Donald Trump. Its sickening and you should keep your children far away from this app. Facebook isnt much better but you can get much more accurate and real news thereI bet you they will even delete this review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good way to stay informed. I dont use this app for news but its a good way to keep up with my friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want in filtered information. Let me discern for myself what is truth. Open up all info and research with out bias. Any influence is bias....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. This App is just like Facebook & Instagram. It is run by people who force & show liberal bias. If I didnt have distant friends & family that I use this to keep up with I wouldnt waste my time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A platform that allows bots to rule it. Twitter. The social media bug on everyones phones whom the United States has to hang on to because it supports an unhinged Individual who makes decrees on it as if it was his personal Messenger to the people. Well thats especially easy when you have an outsider factor making fake accounts, troll accounts, and even spam bots to run unchecked and present misinformation to the people that use their platform on a regular basis. But that doesnt bother them. As long as they get Clicks, views, even regular activity twitter gets paid big time. How? Why just by allowing anyone to buy up ad space. It doesnt matter if its clicked on or not. As long as it shows up on the feed of X amount of people all is fine and dandy because this app definitely makes it easy for you to see the many different advertisers that support twitter. Sure you can report a fake account or spam bot, but twitter isnt gonna do anything  about it. You can even spout nonsense about public shootings being fake and twitter will have your back no matter what (as long as it doesn't stir up a major controversy) let alone they allow people to form hate groups and direct hatred and encourage harm upon those who don't agree with them. Trust me. Dont waste your time with this app unless you need to promote your own business because where else are you gonna go that can easily get the digital foot traffic? Sure theres facebook and instagram but lets face it. The platforms are also rotting from head to toe in media plagiarism to a criminal degree but they allow it simply because it doesnt violate their rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Video upload. Easier to take advantage of all the twitter functionality. I really hope that nobody there can spotlight me from the app and track/stalk or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like watching a friend die. Ive been using Twitter for around 11 years. I had custom wallpapers, 120 characters, hashtags. It was a beautiful experience. I didnt mind when they took the wallpapers away, because they gave us better headers, then they gave us GIFs, then they gave us 240 characters. Things were getting better and better.Now? Now its boiling pot, filled with cancel culture, pro-racism groups, fanatical supporters of football teams, celebrities, and politicians, and has become the new patient zero of fake news sources worse now than Facebook was known for. You cannot hide from sports, drama, scandals, and more. You cant customise your experience in your trending area, and explore still force feeds garbage to you before you can see your actual interests. The recent Spaces feature is already broken and filled with spam. Reporting accounts does nothing. Reporting hashtags that have become flooded with violent and misleading tweets does nothing. You cannot disable sports no matter how hard you try. Twitter, I love you, but youre on the brink of implosion. Youre going the same way as Instagram - an empty husk of your former self. You need to re-evaluate your priorities and business model or youre going to collapse under your own weight. If we could go back to before the Trump era of Twitter, things could feel somewhat peaceful again, but alas, that will never happen. Goodnight, Sweet Prince.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good social media app. This a good social media app to talk about different kind of things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twitter partners with Facebook to destroy social media. By pursuing their own profit and giving louder voices to those who manipulate the system or have created some form of celebrity for themselves you have removed the value of social media is a great equalizer and instead you turned it into a inexpensive marketing medium. By allowing the president to lie constantly you have contributed to the destruction of the United States as an honorable groundbreaking experiment in governance, a national triumph and a global protector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More Free Speech. More censorship then any platform.  Like the blocking feature.  Facebook close second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blocks certain content. I dont need Twitter to screen or do my political thinking for me. Be fair to all sides. You have an agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Control And propaganda. Stop censoring Stop sending me news items out propaganda Im not interested stop putting the narrative in my timeline from people I dont follow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Loved it until. It used to be a great app. You could speak freely. But it seems that only moderate opinions are valued. Yes, ban bots, bigots, threats, and misinformation. But allow the freedom to speak truth to power. I got banned once for asking the FDA how they let a product like X (pic was included) from a major company be sold to the public as it was very gross and clearly unhealthy. They reported me to Twitter and got me banned. It was the only tweet I sent in a while so I know thats what happened. Beyond that, more disturbing, while used to restrict accounts in violation, they never delete our info. Our emails and phone numbers are recorded forever. They dont have the right to a permanent retention of our information nor our data which is also technically info and they legally dont have a right to permanently possess it. Look it up. But yet they keep our emails and phone numbers. If we delete our account we cant come back. It makes me wonder if they even deleted any of the data they said they did . Companies like this need more oversight. If they argue its an attack on their free speech, well, they dont care much for ours, nor our privacy. So they should be open to being frequently audited. If theyre operating in full legal compliance they have nothing to fear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ranking Social Media is a Moot Point. Its like creating a public trash receptacle: Whatever it contains at the end of the day is no credit to the guy who created it, who will spend the recycling money on his personal political causes in order to create a World that more resembles his biased aspirations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politics & Religion. I avoid both on my profiles. However its notable to say its a pretty sad state the media & social media in these current times in the United States. Whats good for some is always bad for others. In any event open political or religious discussions are toxic. Simple differences of opinion at the expense or friendships is just not worth it for me personally.I have no political party. I both agree & disagree with things on BOTH sides of the political isle. So I guess I would call myself independent if anything. I just want to say here in my own words reviewAll the one sided media and bias in this country are shameful. I am a PROUD American. But its pretty clear to me Free Speech & many of the things I grew up to love about my country? Have been KILLED by CLEAR bias & censorship by platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, & Mainstream media etc.Not to worry Politics nor religion are allowed on my feed and I dont reply to political or religious topics when I happen across them. I just wanted to say it my social media experience would be 5 stars with Twitter.IF people could simply agree to disagree, Media was not one sided, & social media would but out & allow people the freedom of speech and education of differences without censoring us.But I will give the 3 stars for convenience and allowing us a place to keep in touch with friends and communities via a public platform. I have no further comments about the clear Bias and dissreguard for the middle class or people to far beneath you to even care about Reviews like mine about the experience on your platform.Seems ALL these platforms are the same. I moved to Twitter to start anew and just make sure I am careful not to follow or comment profiles with strong political or religious standing. Sense its clearly not a place for all voices to be heard and respected equally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best social media platform. You guys are doing a good job. Keep it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uncensored & Unbiased Content. Respect our freedom of information DO NOT CENSOR... LET US BE FREE ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. This social media entity is biased and means to mislead the American Public.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Tired of social media platform censoring anyone that they dont see eye too eye on  So tired of the bias opinions social media sights decide what is appropriate and what they dont agree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Annoying Issue. Lately, Ive been experiencing a problem where on my timeline, peoples profile pictures and various other media wont load. I have a strong signal and Im on LTE, and I have my data usage settings all set to be able to show media on cellular data and wifi. Im not sure why this is happening, and the only way it gets fixed is if I delete and reinstall the app each time it happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sexual content. The amount of accounts dedicated to sex and porno is too much. It should be limited like Facebook does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I never planned on being on Twitter, but along w/FB, Instagram. I never planned on getting on Twitter, FB was enough seeing I wasnt a big social media person.  I came from an age where socializing was more personal or face 2 face.  However, as I started my businesses I realized not only is Twitter a huge tool, but its necessary in todays time.  Its a quick way of getting info in front of the world w/o leaving your house.  Its also a canvas 4 self expression as well as just sharing a kind word.  The other cool thing about Twitter is that is connects u 2 a diversity of ppl/businesses. I that ppl can follow u n there is a possibility of income if u obtain enough followers.  Its become an occupation which allows 1 2 basically work from home or any location that has a WiFi. But, I gave u guys 4 stars cuz Twitter could be better w/fine tuning.  Like allowing group video chats or phone calls like messenger.  Another change that would be great is if youre allowed more characters.  Maybe this function could be added 4 either a fee or depending on your follower count. It would also be nice if we could add a non character driven More about mefield. This would allow users 2 add more details 2 their profile, while letting their followers get 2 know more about them; we should also be able 2 add more pics 2 our profile.  The pics should have there own data spot. So 1 can just view pics w/o going thru the profile window 1st.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My daily news source. Love that I can customize Twitter to feed me just information from the people and organizations I care about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loads of information. I like that you can follow so any different subjects. But this selective banning of opinions has got to stop. Let us decide on the validity of the comments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. Agenda based social media. Very sad.  This is not what America is about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mentions. I dont want other peoples activity and mentions in my mention section. Thats what we all use our timelines for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best. Best social media app available out there and very good news source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I refuse to use an app that so blatantly censors information. Whether that is opinions or proven facts doesnt matter. Its not up to the platform to decode what can be shared or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
privacy concerns. im have a private account with no followers but when i post a video it says i got views on the video.also when i block someone it tells them that i blocked them instead of hiding my profile from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter censorship. Sensors too much info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No longer free speech and seems biased. Not as bad as Facebook. Fact checking is speculative opinion, not 100% fact based. Interesting what Twitter chooses to allow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont share my data. The app is good for reading news and keeping up but not a fan of breaches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social platform responsibility. While the technical aspect & social connectivity of the application is spectacular, the application comes with a responsibility as does any communications medium administered by a third party in the digital age. Your responsibilities to make sure false/fake ID accounts & bots are at the very least identified to all users are a mandate without which you cannot maintain credibility. And credibility will be a currency in high demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A world community of opinions, feelings, thoughts and information. I truly value the ability to see and hear what celebrities, government officials and fellow folks from the general populace say and feel about current events and life in general. The value of seeing the actual words of the actual officials, specialists and other famous folks is enlightening. Whereas communicating with fellow citizens and select social group members is also comforting. Also appreciate the ability to reach out and support others. Yet the major drawback is the problem with fake accounts or malicious bots which try to either attack members, spread lies and propaganda, phish for personal data or otherwise interfere with the open exchange of real points of view and valid information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only social media i am on. I love the app. It is the best place to get fast news and keep up to date on a range of topics. The topics chosen by the app are exactly what i need,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Media (but only if you are a democrat). Terrible app and needs removed from the App Store. Jack Dorsey is a communist that chooses what gets broadcasted on his app. Censorship is completely out of hand and I really hope this will be the end of Twitter for good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom. They do not let everyone use there app and block content by certain people they do not like or if they dont agree with their political opinion. Disgusting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the path to communism. The path to communism starts with big social media apps like Twitter censoring the sitting president of the United States simply because they disagree with him.  Platforms like Twitter apple instagram Facebook are the largest purveyors of information in this age, and even tho they are a private company their influence is cast upon the whole world.  It starts with this.  Dont let them go any further.  Cowards.  Weak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your app and social media format is trash. Trash that makes you stupid. your app is garbage Twitter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Community guidelines. Where is the respect of the private life of others . I see a lot of porn accounts that post private videos that were stolen of celebrities, tiktokers etc. I dont understand how you can let this be ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keeping up to date. Great info source to keep up to date with what is going in your broader networks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything. We don't need to see people's likes on the timeline. We don't need to see old retweets a day or days later. We don't need to see people's replies to tweets on the timeline if we don't follow both people. We don't need to be alerted when our followers follow random accounts. I can't see why anyone would need any of these features and even if they did, there should be a way to turn them off and on. You guys are slowly ruining the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter sensors. Twitter sensors one political spectrum and protects pedophiles. Lauds hate groups and promotes communism and hate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEWS??. #1 for news???? How is a social media app considered news?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. I dont need social media censoring what I read. Thats what dictators do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good for business. Alittle confusing at times but overall a good app. Primarily use it for business purposes, info feeds from other social media accounts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media or Social engineering. I love engaging with others via Social media but the content should never be dictated by a moderator who has the ability to deplatform you because they disagree with what you say. Far too many professionals being silenced for quoting factually correct information deemed to be misleading by some moderator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Policies. Need to allow freedom of speech like the constitution provides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. Extremely Bias social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what twitter needs . hello twitter i know you see this review so we gotta talk . in my opinion you should listen to what your users want because we want stuff that you wont give us and they are very simple things . NO JUSTICE . NO PEACE . until we get these things so allow me to list them . so first and foremost we want to be able to use all fonts for our twitter names . screen readers need to be able to read what it says as well . we want this because everyone wants to be different and we dont all want plain english characters as our  names ; we want flare . next thing we people want is a save tweet button . maybe we have to go to work or go somewhere in general and we want to be able to come back to the tweet or continue reading it . WE CANT EXACTLY DO THAT WITHOUT A SAVE TWEET BUTTON TWITTER  i have many things id like to read over or come back to but i CANNOT because yall chose NOT to add a save tweet button like INSTAGRAM . yeah i threw shade . NEXT we need to be able to stay occupied whyll others are typing so i think itll be nice if we could play games as well in the messages like you can on snapchat . we get bored on twitter sometimes and it can be hard to start a conversation with someone you never met but if you add a couple simple , fun , interactive games , it would make it a lot easier . this is a social platform right ? okay then . FINALLY i believe you should have a camera area where you can take pictures , boomerangs , and videos like instagram but have timers to start the video or to take a photo if you wanna take one without having to hold or press the button . i really hope i helped out and you all read this because i put a lot of effort into this review .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"useful. You actually get the instagram likes and followers you need It is awesome because it gave me a lot of followers, I almost have 2000 followers, it's awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. Most politically bias social media app there is available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Options. I would like to prioritize my feeds. I would like to have categories such as news, travel, politics, art, nature, opinion etc that I could select.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What I think is useful. I don't tweet much so I'll refrain on that portion. I find it a better way to access almost instantaneously to news events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"selectivity helps. Twitter can be a strange place. I use it to follow journalists who are often reporting real time. Minimizing following acquaintances can help streamline the feed. I wish there were a way to organize it by topic, which is why I only give it a 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Profile view. Needs a way to sort out retweets from a persons profile, should be tweets and replies, retweets, and media",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free speech. Your lack of allowing free speech and slanted  policing of information is completely biased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social media is bad, mkay. Social media is bad mkay, creates false illusions of the average human life/households. Not only that, but social media I.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are used as platforms for mass manipulation and the spread of false information, mkay. Dont get manipulated, mkay. Youll be brainwashed and wont even know youre brainwashed, and being brainwashed is bad. So just try and steer clear, mkay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. You are the best .  Short and to the point application ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Socializing is free media is not. Thanks Tim Crooke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias. I like the way the app works but twitters bias against conservatives is out of control.    They really do need government regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter is crazy to censor content. I dont need you to tell me what information is from the so called authority.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My opinion. This is a good social media because us can write things about our day or any thing also is a great application for watch notice about what happen in the country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Learning. One of the many things I like is DM (direct Message) to things like Apple Support. Several companies, VERIZON support. Find peoples thought on shows.give your views, I do not go to any other social media except twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Choice?. We live in a free society, I dont need Twitter to fact check or monitor what I read.  Im disappointed with social media thinking they are the truth and take liberties away from Americans.  Free America from bias social media platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bias and censorship. When did social media have more power than the current sitting president of the United States of America? Im so disappointed and disgusting by the censorship of conservatives on this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the point. Allows you to get your point out. As long as they dont go down the Facebook road and start banning people. Else gab is the solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. They are to quick to judge someone and block there accounts for now reasons. And they are killing freedom of speech just like Facebook are doing. So Twitter and Facebook sort yourselves out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better. Better than Facebook for Politics but not perfect  You take away my followers and lose my posts. Stay out of the opinion business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The utmost reliable source of everything. Used correctly / and trough verified sourcesIt does provide you with info ,events ,photos, recipes........It is the ONLY platform I rely on. It should be mentioned that has demonstrated over the years their  next-to-none responsiveness to the garbage seen on others. Therefore  1/2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drews feedback. I feel u offered me the definition of social media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just does what it should. Works well feeding you with tweets that follow your interests. The Twitter world seems to be inhabited by people of higher intelligence unlike Facebook. The advertising is present but not intrusive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very Useful tool for staying up to date. It provides access to news unattainable by regular news channels. News from the turmoil in Venezuela, for example. Twitter is able to sidestep the regime censorship over news events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best social media. Twitter is my favorite app. I can keep up with news relevant to me and keep up with my friends and fave celebrities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misinformation and idiocy abundance. As a social media platform this app grossly spreads misinformation to deceive, manipulate, and confuse people. Young people are especially susceptible because of their still developing brains and high vulnerability to manipulation.  Further, the agenda and biases of the managing staff are clear even though they advocate fairness and freedom of speech which is a facade.  Social media is leading to the dumbing down of our society, the more connected we become on media, the more distant we become to each other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep your political stance personal. I love this app. The problem is this app or its censors don&#39;t love me. I was locked out of my account and stripped of around 15k followers. So it&#39;s a great app if you never let them know your political stance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is America. Censorship of life-saving information is a crime against humanity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TWITTER IS. Better than FaceBook FACTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great social media app. I use it more than I use Facebook its just that awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Big brother run amok. Selectively applies all of their policies while monitoring everything that people tweet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Executive constructive opinions. Instagram is important because a picture paints a thousand words. However twitter is just as important because words are the truth. And it doesnt matter what they look like. Its about what. They said. Which is just priceless about Twitter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy suggestion. Why cant I keep my profile private and therefore the tweets I just post to my profile versus still being able to comment publicly on posts from users I follow?? Facebook and Instagram both allow this. I am a huge fan of twitter but I like keeping my profile private but would still like to comment publicly on tweets from accounts I follow. Address this situation and I will five star,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good source of media. I am not one for chatting ones business on a media site, unless it proteins to cyber awareness; however, I have family and friends in all parts of the world and twitter helps me keep in touch with all whom I hold most dear. Thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedoms of speech. I dont like how they can control whos on the app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensorship. Its ridiculous that a social media platform feels the need to sensor a certain side of things just because they do not agree with that side. Feel that twitter has lost its way and is using its power witch its a massive power to push their beliefs. I truly believe that everyone is entitled to an opinion even if its an opinion someone doesnt agree with. Hope all is well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Blocks/Cancels/Censors valid information. Good social platform, bad platform for facts or information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bias. This platform is bias, if ur a conservative and or republican,Trump supporter u get sensor. Twitter and Facebook are taking away our free speech a little at a time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Twitter use. I read many posts daily.  I post a couple of times per year when the subject escalates me to do so. Twitter allows me to view the entire universe of responses without a partisan summary. I find it a useful tool in helping me to maintain objectivity... in a world controlled by bias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News access. The news access to this app is very bias and can be super misleading to a lot of individuals who dont have easy access or interest to access the news.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This rocks. This social media is like no other get it while you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
garbage. this app is textbook definition garbage. use any other social media. probably the worst out there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased policy and no transparency. Biased policy and no transparency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Best Social Media App Hands Down. Fight me about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook fights human rights by deleting stories about Palestine and supporting Israeli terrorism. Twitter fights human rights by deleting stories about Palestine and supporting Israeli terrorism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Media. As far as Social Media goes... I really like Twitter, Facebook, google, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn and Goodreads. I love how social media enables us to connect socially which I believe is a basic human need like food, water and shelter. I wish people were more nice to each other on this platform but oh well you cant get everything you want. A girl can dream tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Responsible Media. Thanks for policing and removing incendiary accounts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The adults social platform. I use it to  get breaking news and analysis from sound thinkers that I can verify, less the social network gaffe and more a media think tank. More work to do but in a faster work this platform can keep up, and deliver sound information as long as you curate your sources",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. This app is wonderful if you would like to be censored and only get the media / info that they would like you to get so if you dont know how to think for yourself this app is definitely for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good social media app. Better than Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delet this. social media is ded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, and propaganda platform. Highly biased and stifles free speech. An incredibly faulty social app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter is a Data mine of everything you do. Its DARPA dont know what DARPA is you should. No freedom of speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Sick of them censoring conservative people, many of whom are mainstreamregardless it shouldnt matter (no political censorship). Otherwise, its the best social media app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More to know. I would like if Twitter would let us post storys like Instagram and Facebook I think its  also a good way to get information then posting because not a lot of people will stop and look at what you said and if they see you posted on a story per say then they might take an interest but Twitter is about information and bringing it to the surface and I have more ideas but thats all for now bye ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media. Its meh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship machine. Social media playforms should have no say in politics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A waste of time. Its like Facebook you are only to share what they want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easy Info site. A lot of information to receive or to display.They keep most the garbage off their site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech. Stop censoring people. Twitter was my favorite app and I was loyal for years. Sadly I cant watch it happen anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship = Twitter. I am tired of the censorship I am tired of Twitter telling me what I can and cannot view. I have 95% MOVED over to PARLER. Twitter and Facebook/Instagram seem to belong to the same company You would never guess that they were run independently. I will get my new from a source that does not feel the need to decide for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doing what it should to protect the truth. Proud of Twitter for doing what it did, protecting the public from false information at time most get their news only from social media cant be more important",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abuse. There is A LOT of different types of Abuse Social Media has NOT caught up on. Also Social Media needs to STOP these Fake Accounts created of famous celebrities. This Social Media allowing this, it makes Social Media unsafe for everyone. There should be keywords that automatically alerts that Social Media Network such as sending money, gift cards, & etc.. Also Blackmailing is Abuse. An account should be automatically closed when this happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy concerns. Twitter on iOS shares data with google for , among other things, translate tweets. Use with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twitter. Like the twitter app. But it is concerning that they ban folks who share information they disagree with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politics. Why does Twitter get to tell me what to like and not like? This is a communist platform, this app and other like it (Facebook) will be what will bring America to its end Anti trump anti American and  pro China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Policing and censorship. twitter polices way too much.  Better to categorize accounts such as political, adult etc.  always weed out fake accounts scams and hackers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sensorship. Came to Twitter mainly for sports  Fastest breaking news for sports is here, however when they start taking away other peoples free speech in the political side of things it make me say its not worth it.  I can wait an extra minute to find out sports updates instead of allowing them to dictate what I am allowed to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consistency. Stop biases. Stay out of political agendas. Groups are targeted. Consistently apply said rules. Assure not restricting any one group. The news & information, current events are good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well no more. Succ this 8==&gt; you crappy app.Social media has created more harm than help. It has destroyed so many relationships. It has destroyed trust in friendships. It has influence people to not think on their own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mum Wife PQ Accountant More Respect for our Beautiful Planet. As a very busy Mum of 3 &amp; P/T Accountant, Twitter has allowed me 1)Free Access to current unbiased news stories, articles &amp; reports &amp; findings from various reliable sources, which underline very important issues which affect us all,imminently, in the long run &amp; is extremely important for us all to be aware of &amp; to explain to all of our children (it affects their future the most.) Hopefully we can all work to mend or support certain findings 2)Twitter is Education, if you find the reliable truthful transparent sources 3)Twitter can also be a place to share your thoughts &amp; beliefs, although, obviously, this can sometimes put you at risk, if there are people who strongly disagree or disapprove , or if people have the soul intention to harm or exploit, so protection/warnings need to be present. I am a protected account for this reason. 4)Twitter can also be Entertainment which can cheer you up when you need it. It can also give ideas. 5) can also be a place of Support It gives access to many Charities &amp; valuable, possibly life-saving support It can be a very Caring place 6) However, I do not approve of the mob culture which I sometimes see. Twitter is a user platform &amp; cant be blamed for this though, unless this culture is encouraged with analytics, or should there be more rules &amp; regulations on the platforms to protect the many? Tough question I dont know the answer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the hell. Really I don't mind social media. But there's a point till you realize is it worth it. There are several snobs out there that think having followers in the thousands makes them better or those who are promote public shaming for a man who was wrongly fired. There are good people out there. But don't bother turning on notifications unless you want to blow up your phone. Also it's politically biased and wrongfully silencing those against fake news. In that regard you could consider it a one star review. Don't be surprised when your publically attacked by an adult."",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My twitter. My best source of information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. Controlling information and are biased toward conservative views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ONLY SOCIAL MEDIA I USE . As it turned out Twitter ended up being my favorite app to express myself love this APPPPPPP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government regulation needed. Only allowed to follow a one party line no discussion here. Should be banned in USA.This kind of political censorship is common in China and Russia.  Freedom of the press is essential for democracy. Hope they go bankrupt because I cant read ads if I cant read content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Literally the best social media ever . I so love this app cause I\'m able to stay connected with my fan army which is really more than enough cause no other social media has that to offer and things are so optimized and jus everything about it is jus amazing and better in every way than Facebook which is already dead lol, jus thank you so much for making this app it really is amazing ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals Data. Steals all you personal data and sells it to the highest bidder.  Facebook needs to promote privacy and security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information stealing. The amount of information facebook digitally assumes as being rightful to share with third parties is  ludicrous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unusable and unsecured. Your info is not private with facebook. Their policies are unfair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy concerns. Facebook collects sensitive data about its users, that we are unsure how it is being used.Facebook also deletes information it doesnt agree with- no true freedom of speech.It also deletes accounts that present a differing opinion or controversial opinion. P  egg pe d as could have access to all information to make their own decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracks you. Facebook is openly known to track and steal your data and then sell it to third party companies while also turning it over to the government. They also censor any information they think doesnt fit their agenda. Many people have been reported to the police or FBI because of things they posted on their private stories because Facebook turned them over. If you want to live a private and peaceful life, avoid this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stay Away. If you do not already use Facebook, do not download it. At this time, Facebook is being used by its developers as a Political Tool for their own personal gain.Facebook personnel as well as other major social networking sites have been spamming information from disputed sources for all of 2020 and continue to do so after being questioned about it in court by the federal government. Most of this information leans extremely left, all the while, they are specifically targeting and flagging any information from a right perspective as false information, without the ability to dispute either side.The conflict of interest plays into their own gain such that their view on politics is to keep everyone quarantining at home so that they are forced to entertain themselves using social media platforms such as Facebook, which in turn, makes them more money through adds.Facebook is used all over the world and is a physical part of a many many lives to the point where it could be considered a utility. The actions taken by Facebook are a complete abuse of power forcing many people to change their lifestyle during a very stressful period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is trash and sells your data to third parties. Facebook is trash and sells your data to third parties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook. A total waste of time and energy, if you want your data to be monitored, your privacy to be violated then use this disgraceful application",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They make money off of your info. Facebook is no longer what is used to be, they censor everything if it doesnt follow their agendas and they make money off of your Data information, they no longer have any context to what privacy means anymore, use it a your own risk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steal your information. Facebook uses all of your information and sell it without your permission. I decided to stop it after the 1.4.5 ios update, after which, facebook insisted to ask me to let them collect information about myself from other apps on my device",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data privacy. Facebook sells our data to third parties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Facebook provides no privacy they steal all out information and sell it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook steals and sells your data. Dont use this platform. They are stealing and selling your personal information right under your nose Dont let Facebook listen and track you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insecure and Violating Privacy. Based of a lot of research, Facebook doesn&#39;tq mind privacy and sell personal information to the other companies  You can search for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concern. Will steal your privacy. Facebook will steal your privacy and leave you open to all kinds of fraud through tracking.  Do not download. Not recommended. Please be aware of your rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Im only giving Facebook one star and only to write this review. This is a Public service announcement and a review about Facebook the company better known as Facebook has flagged my email and has disabled my account for no reason at all. Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made. I would not recommend this social platform for anybody because they track you using GEO location on your phone, monitor your microphone, and camera, and watch you 24/7  they require your physical address, phone number, and email, they require you to upload a photo ID or birth certificate. Meta previously known as Facebook is in association with 3rd party corporations in China where they take all data collected on you and sell it to big businesses and profit off your rights to use their services. They monitor each like, comment, and message made through Facebook app or messenger. It is not safe and idk why its even legal to use in the United States. As far as Im concerned Facebook is a CIA platform and is only free to the public to monitor and track each person online. They even monitor you when you arent using their app. As long as you have the app downloaded on your device regardless online or offline they still watch and monitor you, they track your microphone and your camera so Id be advised and delete the app, go to something else like MySpace, or something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They sell your privacy. Facebook sells everything from your phone. Including name, social security number etc to third party for money. They are hackers you let in your phone when you download it. As simple as that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do not access any of my info. Facebook Do not access any of my info nor use it for any reason or for any circumstances. I dont like your policy.Hmmm, why I use it, I use it because I communicate with family and friends, and thats why I gave you one star",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concern. Facebook has no respect to consumers privacy and they collect every possible data and spy on users to sell our information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook used to be fun now its pathetic. The fact that it is impossible to get someones photo part taking in illegal dug activity, but when someone chooses to discuss their faith in god over poison or holistic treatments over other alternatives its a problem. Their help desk is useless. They never respond except with something automated, which does not help. Additionally, the features to hide people or their content is harder than before. I logged on my settings page to view what app information was being tracked by Facebook. Most of it wasnt concerning except my banking app. Why should Facebook have access to that? Clearly they should not. I cleared and removed but I dont know what exact information was collected by Facebook or how it was used and they will not provide an answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I dislike how Facebook intrudes with users information without users knowing about it That is a violation of peoples privacy They should be more open and transparent letting everyone know how they use their information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook has access to my data. Planning to remove my account soon. I dont like someone watching my history and data. Worst business model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals your Data and Censors You. Facebook is notorious for using its data to manipulate its users buying decisions. It then sells your data as well. They will also have an extreme bias deciding whether a posts gets deleted or not aligned with their political objective. Do Not Recommend any of Facebooks products,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Really violates my private information to much to be worth it. Shame on facebooks for treating people like commodities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy breaches. Facebook keeps all your details and shares your private photos etc, dont upload or share anything, they keep it all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invades youre privacy, steals your content. Doesnt matter what your security/privacy settings are, Facebook takes all your content and uses it for their own purposes.    And one purpose is to manipulate and monitor you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They sell your information. Someone should break this monopoly up. They sell your profile. Facebook is not answerable to any agency, so they violate freedom of speech. Dont waste your time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont use this anymore. With all privacy and security concerns, Facebook has been making use of our data without our concern. It does not take into consideration our personal life and our data keeps getting hacked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Discrimination. Its a shame that Facebook was created to share information but that Information gets deleted by Facebook because its not their personal politics or their point of view. Its one sided. I get its a business and they could do what they want, but the business is about to go away real quick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invading privacy. Facebook is probably the worst privacy violator in the world. It is becoming ridiculous that one company has so much personal data and the way they you use. This has to stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete Facebook. Stores all sorts of data and information about you.It removes anything that does suit them, but allows abuse, lies etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing your information. Facebook steals your information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal information. Facebook is shady and is not in the best interest of its users. If my family didnt use this app theres not a chance it would be on my phone. I hope u enjoy my data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook steals data and then sells it. Facebook is tracking your every move, stop giving them your valuable data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whats in the box?. Where does all the data go? Facebook is stealing personal data from users and is censoring users based on said data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disgusting business tactics. Facebook has decided to collect your data, sell it to others, and then categorize you according to the information you share, even if said information can help save a life or prevent tragedy. They arent interested in individuality, truth, or freedom whatsoever. They are interested in control. Lets show Big Tech who needs whom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very bad privacy standards. Facebook continues to collect data on its users, even when user wish not to be tracked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is Privacy nightmare. FB will sell your soul (or data) to the devil for a few cents if they could If you read their new terms of service you would be terrified. You have no privacy for you or anything on your phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out of touch. Facebook is out of touch with the privacy and social context that users thought or think they have. In general the app is more complicated to move around and does a great job in thinking your information is safe when in fact it is far from it.It will be interesting to see if it is around in the future.Best thing I have ever done is deleted my account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dangerous. Facebook exists to harvest your data. They take no responsibility for any consequences of their activities, and their platform is full of misinformation that they take little interest in removing. Do not use their services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Violations. Download your data and you will learn things about you that Facebook shouldnt know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issue. Not a fan of how using Facebook steals private info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals too much information. The Facebook app collects websites and other apps you use on your phone and stores the information on the app. God knows what else it can read or pick up and every time I have talked about something or searched it on google, Ive had an advertisement for it. It 100% listening to you without you knowing as Ive spoken to people about without putting it into my phone and minutes later Ill have an advertisement for it. Its a joke and wont be using it anymore. Also, the censorship is rife If you post anything against the governmentsNarrative you get banned or your post will be removed... whereas Ive come across profiles and groups exploiting children and when reported, it never goes against fb community standards. So basically, if youre a nonse youre free to do what you want on fb.. but if your life is being ruined by your government you better stay hush hush if you want to keep your account.. NAZIBOOK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing info. Facebook has a feature called off Facebook activity which allows them to steal your information from your other installed apps without your knowledge. Facebook had access to my dating apps and bank apps on my phone and does not specify what info they have access to. Hope you enjoy my nudes Zuckerberg, Id appreciate if you asked beforehand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Facebook is trash. Stopped using it because its trash and useless. Only useful for Suckerberg to make money off of the people who continue to stay on it. They do nothing to protect your information, they just sell you to highest bidder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals Information. Making Facebook required to run devices and apps owned by the user while Facebook steals private information should be illegal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too much private data used. There is no need for the amount of data Facebook collects and retains. We are just lumps of money making data lining the pockets of a disingenuous corporation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A tool of the elitists to divide the people. If you are using Facebook to talk about irrelevant and light hearted things then it will pretty much leave you to do that, with the obvious caveat that it will spy on you and use your data for intelligence gathering and advertising revenue. However, if you attempt to share information that is pertaining in any way to state corruption, medical fraud, media manipulation or any other topics considered conspiratorial then you will be censored. Facebook will censor you because it is absolutely a tool of the globalist elitists who dominate the world and want to completely remove any and all challenges and obstacles to their total control agenda. Obstacles such as your human rights, your medical freedom, your right to protect your children from harm etc. Use Facebook at you own risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not use. Facebook has to much power. They censor and sell your data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasive Data Collection. Your personal information is at risk with Facebook. This is clearly listed under Data Linked to You and  Data Used to Track You. Facebook is vacuuming up your personal date across its apps, then use it to make money by targeting you with Ads, etc. Dont be a product they can sell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No privacy in Facebook. Facebook constantly gives away customers personal information to other companies. Dont use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No justice in FB. In the early days Facebook was supposed to be a harmless and fun way to stay connected with old friends. However it has become so much more then that. It&#39;s interesting that if you are chatting about certain things - holiday destinations for example - suddenly you start getting ads for that country 9.1 can&#39;t believe the level of spying they actually do and the information they collect on you. It&#39;s quite scary just how much of our information they can collect. FB stated We use the data we have  for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our products  to personalize your experience.&#34; What the agreement actually means is that : &#34;We will collect your personal information on and off the platform and give it to advertisers who market ads specifically for you.&#34; Unfortunately, the users are usually the last to understand this. So to me that means it&#39;s running in the background even if I don&#39;t have it open - it has access to everything on my phone- no thank you I have deleted the app. I do not want an app which is in essence spying on me 24 hours a day Don&#39;t even get me started on the censoring or allowing the platform to be used by apartheid or racist organisations - my advice is avoid downloading it if u can and delete if you already have it. Having said that FB also own Insta and have been doing similar things on that platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and Usability. First off, my personal info was leaked online due to the cambridge analytics scandal.The app has no controls over your online status displayed to others when youre using it. You cannot browse facebook without others knowing you are online.This is an absolute deal breaker for me. If it werent for facebook marketplace I would delete my account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking what you do offline. I dont understand how Facebook can WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION, track EVERYTHING you do off of Facebook. On your phone. That should be illegal You had all of my banking information, contacts, messages off Facebook, phone calls, all the apps Ive used, my emails, etc And never asked me ONCE, if I would allow you guys to track this information",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook sells your data. Not a fan of how Facebook collects all of my data and sells it to government agencies or corporations. This is a criminal application. Watch what you write. P.S. if this review gets taken down, you already know why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is a Cesspool. Cesspool of lies, politics, fake news, threats, sex and pornography, illegal immigration business and people fighting over their own 2 cents, political views and personal feelings. This social media can be used for so many illegal activities. I once reported an account of my friend that was made a copy and have been requesting us to accept her friend request and been asking for money but she said its not actually her and its been using all her details from name to photos. So what we did was report it to Facebook and the Goddamn reply was this dis not go against Facebook policy That blew me off",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy. Just look below to all of the data that Facebook uses that is linked to you for their profit.big thumbs down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. Facebook is not God.  They think they rule you and your information.  When you sign up you just type in information.  They want to lock you out and to get back on your need to send them your personal information like photo copy of drivers license or passport. Im would never send anyone that personal information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Facebook has access to a lot of sensitive informations  , that is not acceptable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you care about your privacy stay away. I had to deactivate my Facebook account after I have found that everything I doing in Facebook is being shared with third party companies to understand what Im thinking about, for example when I show some interest in something in Facebook suddenly I find this thing coming to me everywhere on the internet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing information. Its not worth it. Once you install Facebook they track sensitive data and sell it to the highest bidder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and fact checking. Facebook has knowingly suppressed information, censors and fact checks facts it does not want you to know. It weaponizes our data for their own agenda. We are just starting to see in America what they have brazenly done in other countries with much less oversight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. Facebook does not only gather our information. (which most of us became fine with eventually) but also censors information and blocks whatever they see as threat. which includes many humanitarian cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Using data to cause chaos. Facebook has never assumed the responsibility that it has towards people its profiting off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and usage. Honestly Facebook is a terrible company and this is a terrible app. Facebook is so bloated that its impossible to use, theres too much going on. Not only that but Facebooks product is you and not the application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook not only accesses your information but even when you site credible sources tells people its false, unless of course it fits their narrative.  Have items to sell, wait a minute lets hope its not for breastfeeding those things get flagged.  Facebook is a joke. Parlor is better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Blatant censorship & Evil Agenda. Facebook was once useful but now it is absolutely toxic There are newer and better social sites now like Float, MeWe, Voice, &amp; Parlor where your factual posts wont be deleted. At FB you and your data are the product not the consumer. Be very careful what you share here because your data is being used against you. Your conversations, contacts, images, and locations are being stored for future use against you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tracking data and selling user info. Facebooks whole business model is formed around tracking users and selling their data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Steals Personal Info. Do not trust Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Marketing and censorship. Facebook is no longer a social network. It is a marketing platform only. The only thing Facebook cares about is its marketers and all policies and functions put it in place support that and not its users. None of your information is private. The censorship of information pushes whatever agenda Facebook is being paid to push.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook doesnt understand privacy. Selling your data , tracking your and their app is trash full of memes and ads , keeps exposing my Online status when Im offline , every time I open the app there it goes Im online when I have it off",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible Data Security. Facebook is selling your info. Also make sure you dont care about your profile or connections because they can ban you without cause or reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. Facebook uses fact checkers who arent independent. Their facts contradicts the truth and they are trying to silica the truth. They snoop around your Facebook and site things for being false when its from official sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Beware all your information is vulnerable to theft in this application. I do not recommend it. There is absolutely no privacy. Facebook sells your information to another party.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and censorship . Close your account if you can. Facebook privacy terms are a joke. Equally, Facebook censors just causes to please governments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misused information. I wouldnt recommend Facebook , it uses your data to share with strangers, allows online predators to seek children, its not safe and not secure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor privacy practices. Look at all the data Facebook collects. Its insane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its business and your data is the commodity. Facebook used to be about community and sharing. All it is now is a glorified data miner for your data and they are making billions off of you. You give them your soul and they give your soul to others. Its become nothing more than mindless tv with advertisements everywhere. All eyes are on you and ears and location and likes and dislikes, etc. Facebook needs to be illegal. Its practices are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Privacy. When you delete the app from your account the Facebook company still collects your data. Beware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STEALING INFORMATION. FACEBOOK IS STEALING YOUR INFORMATION AND SELLING IT. This is a spyware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.they track you at times on are off Facebook. They censor your free speech and will put you in Facebook jail if you voice your opinion.  I would stay far away from this site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tracking. Facebook tells entire life information without permission they should at least ask users to show information they want with Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasion of privacy. They sell out your info, even personal texts or pictures not having anything to do with Facebook, they sell it to 3rd parties for advertising purposes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AVOID...If you value your privacy. Probably the worst app ever when it comes to privacy, their terms and conditions means Facebook own anything you put up even after deleting your account Facebook will have a copy somewhere. So beware what you upload. Just avoid it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Entitlement. facebook inc. has become one of the big oligopolies around data and now that transparency is here about what data from users is collected, everything becomes clear Stop throwing tantrums like a child and respect your users. After 13 years, I have no issue saying good bye to facebook, because my data is my personal choice to share or not, not a commodity for you to profit from. Small businesses were doing fine before you were ever a thing and they will be doing fine if you are gone, stop the cry baby behaviour. Not cute anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy invasion. Facebook has been on the ride for more than a decade now. It has reached the point that not only has limitless data for every user but it\'s using it to manipulate essential aspects of our lives.Timeline? They show you what they want based on what draws your attention (yes their algorithm knows what you like and what not) News? Same samePages? They can and will allow only what is allowed and not what people are genuinely want to express them.Facebook serves a purpose and is NOT there to help you connect with your family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Control. Facebook are controlling your life. There is no privacy, they spy on you, bombard you with adverts and use your personal data. Run a mile now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use of information without consent. Facebook spy on your conversations and if you are speaking about certain topics with friends even with phone not in use - you start to receive adverts on your phone based on those conversations with friends etc...  should not be allowed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trash. Facebook is where you go to have your data sold to third party apps, while not being able to speak your mind without being censored. I understand its a free service, so technically they dont have to help you with anything. But straight looking like a communist dictator controls it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. With a company with as many data breaches and collecting of user data is amazing how people still use Facebook and Facebook services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"READ DATA INFRINGEMENTS THEY STEAL. I cannot express enough for you to read the data that Facebook takes. It is EVERYTHING you do on your phone They know what websites you go on, what photos youve taken, where you are, access your camera and audio the list is endless- just read the permissions in this app for you to see it for yourself in black and white Once youve installed this app you will surely get spam phone calls, spam emails, adverts in your Facebook from where youve visited in person as it knows your location. I see Ads in my newsfeed in every 1 in 3 posts. I have deactivated my account and once Ive printed off all my photos from here then Ill be deleting Facebook permanently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No user privacy control. Facebook continually pushes the envelope for privacy intrusion. Facebook has no respect for users and hold the belief that your information is open season. I for one believe its time for government sanctions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I deleted the app after looking at the insane amount of private data that facebook consumes and uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pure garbage. Facebook doesnt allow you to voice your opinions and at the same time prys into personal information shares it with companies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is trash. I stopped using Facebook because of the privacy concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues. This application does not respect privacy standards, Facebook is monitoring us and using all device sources to eavesdrop on users from a camera, microphone, location, etc.The management of this company sells all our information to companies and we do not know what this information is used for and is largely used badly towards users  We all have to be careful about this application and take into account all the powers that we give to this company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Customer Service. It is the worst. I cant access my account and have no recourse to contact Facebook in any way. Any other business with these practices would be OUT of business ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Double standards and violation of privacy. Facebook is a tool that is used now and regardless of the direction or tendencies of its founders or those in charge of it, it is used or is in which support and promotion of corrupt causes and support for bad and oppressive extremist groups that usurp the land, honor and homelands such as Israel, where they are supported and promoted their entitlement at the expense of the grievance of the Palestinian people. Facebook also violates the privacy policy through  Threatening to close the account if the individual&#39;s personal information is not allowed to be shared",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"False Fact Checkers.. The platform has become a breeding ground for political toxicity, fake news, and they censor you every time you say anything that is remotely close to being pro right-winged politically, or anything that goes against the left wing agenda. They will label anything based on evidence and fact that goes against left wing politics as false information - checked by independent fact checkers and then dont give you any sort of chance to appeal your post/picture, making the entire platform based in a political bias. The entire facebook platform uses location history data (down to the hour), as well as microphone data, ect, and sells your personal information that they gather from this data to 3rd party advertisers such as Wish. They then spam your feed with excessive advertsements of things that are EXTREMELY relevant to your life in general. This is called personalized advertisements.Many apps/services do it, but facebook has an entirely malicious way of doing it, based on my experience. If you dont upload a picture of your face to the platform after a certain time frame of creating an account, they ask that you upload a picture of your drivers license/ ID card to confirm your identity. Facebook is in legal no position to ask for this information to confirm you are who you say. But the loopholes theyve made in their terms of service have made it to where if you accept the terms, they are no longer in the wrong for asking for this information legally, so its up to the users discretion whether or not they want to proceed.Need I say more?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal Security/Privacy. I have used Facebook for a long time. The more and more Facebook updates the more into our privacy you get. Not to mention all the bugs and glitches. Get out of our life,  it is NONE of your business what company or service we look up. This off Facebook activity junk is TOO much. Facebook does not need to have any of that information. Keep your ads if you have to, but stay off our phones. This is getting ridiculous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracks all usage on phone including bank and other information. Facebook tracks everything on your phone if it is installed including apps that arent Facebook. Its called Off-Facebook activity it can be disabled but of course is enabled by default , I believe that that should be against Apples TOS as well as illegal because they are tracking you without your consent and could potentially expose sensitive data that you do not wish to share with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your personal information. Facebook sells your unstructured and structured data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They want your data. Facebook wants to know every little think they can about you. I wouldnt use it unless you have to They have 2.8 on here, thats a trash rating. Dont trust em",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They just care about selling your personal info. All they care about is how much of your personal information they can gather and sell. Facebook has went way downhill since it first started I only used it mainly for selling on marketplace and business networking but now i wont even be using it for that after they removed my latest marketplace item for no reason when i have been buying and selling on marketplace for years and have a 5 star rating Facebook is worthless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook Avoid avoid avoid. Deletes and covers up information relevant to public health, not to mention selling of information to 3rd parties",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FACEBOOK STEALS SO MUCH DATA FROM YOU. This app, along with the whats app and messenger app collect so much data from you. Dont think its secure when youre sharing information privately. Facebook is collecting as much data as possible across its products to make money off you Unacceptable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Decay and decline. FB has turned into an out of control tool of oppression. They sell your private data, use psychological techniques to influence you and your decisions. Manipulate you and deceive you with their so-called fact-checkers. They ban you off to why dont like what you say and censor you in many other ways as well. They decide what you see on your own timeline and in what order you will see it, if ever. They use targeted advertising from all the ways they track and and watch you. Its a terrible, terrible company completely out of touch with what liberty and freedom really are. I urge everyone to leave FB, delete your account completely, and never look back. There are much better alternatives where you wont be the product. Yes, in Facebook, you are the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Facebook privacy policy is always controversial, I want my information to be safe thats why I dont trust Facebook on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals everything. Facebook just steals all your info , sells it you get nothing but spam and adds in return .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Collects user data. Facebook is collecting user data without users aware of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Basically Spyware. Facebook is censoring data, collecting data, filtering content that is against their narrative while promoting false information that goes along with their corporate worldview. They are using their platform to spy on users, sell their information, its a national security threat. Im deleting the app and encourage you to do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy disaster. Stop using Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero personal data privacy. There is nothing called personal data privacy when using Facebook. By force they collect everything about you. Started by respecting data privacy to get people using it and then it changed the conditions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information shared. Facebook is a platform for personal information exploitation I deleted Facebook accounts but I have a dead account I cannot access and Facebook has locked me out.. Ive contacted a lawyer.. I dont know why Facebook boss not censor sexual content but will censor words written that does not fit into Facebooks extortion guidelines.. do not download this platform ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marketplace. One of the biggest reasons I kept Facebook was for the buying and selling features of marketplace.  However, even that has become complicated and not user friendly. Its difficult to search locally now that everyone is encouraged to ship items. There are somethings I very much like to see in person before purchasing and lots of things Ive sold in the past that now arent even getting views. Too bad to see such a great platform stop working for the people that use it. I dont appreciate the push of facebooks political  ideals on everything I see from the Facebook banner flying lgbtq+ symbols to Covid/vaccine reminders, recommendations, quizzes or fact checks regarding the virus. The censorship is unreal, yet when I report an account for soft pornography or inappropriate content Im told it does not violate guidelines. Its not even a place to see updates from friends as the algorithm dictate who and what you see and dont see. I miss the days of seeing all the posts from all my friends. If Facebook didnt have pictures and memories from my past posts/experiences, Id have deleted it long ago. That now is my sole reason for keeping my account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crap service. Fb is collecting your data without your consent and reminding you 2tears later of post memories i feal everything on facebook should be in the hands of the users wright to agree on not to be sensored  or be unsafe or vicktum to theft facebook theft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook. Facebook sells your information. Its not a trusted site. Really should dismantled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whats there to say. They steal your data and then monetize it. Thats their business. You get bupkas EVERYBODY USE FAKE INFO FOR FACEBOOK AND THERE IS NOTHING TO MONETIZE. I DID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Youre personal information is not safe. My FB &amp; instagram accounts were deleted after one of their employees hacked into my personal private information, photos, etc. I believe this was done to cover their tracks as it was very easy to figure out what happened. Its been over a week and I still have not been able to secure my private account, information, &amp; photos. Facebook needs to be prosecuted for violating its users civil rights. Once I secure my memories I will be deleting everything on my own. Goodbye Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook Account Held Hostage Unless I Give them Extremely Sensitive Personal Information. First, I was mysteriously logged out of all my devices. In the second place, I must go through a tedious two factor authentication process, which I had never approved. I am unable to log in to my Facebook account without providing official ID, or extremely sensitive personal information. On researching and troubleshooting this problem, youll find that the guidelines are subordinated to a singular point of view, that Facebook is some sort of legitimate record keeping / census authority. Dont do it. Youd have to be a real fool to go along with this; in fact, Id even challenge the legality of being obliged to give such info to a badly secured private corporation if it hadnt occurred to me that I dont want to use their product anymore if thats the sort of world I would have to live in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not enough protect our privacy. Facebook is the one of the worst company who steal all your information whenever you are as they believe they havent done any harm. They turned their blind to keep nick in your information and sell out to 3rd party. Even worst part is they are Pro-Israel. They are racist and they do not care about us. Just monies all they care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, personal info leaked. Facebook is the worst social media app there is, it takes censorship and tracking to an obscene level. All of your information is fed into other sites and your whereabouts and search history available for the government. I had my credit card information leaked. Its time to retire this platform all together if you havent already, because its outdated, unfair, controlling and completely useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Honest review. Facebook has conditionally updated their terms and service to take advantage of you. It has become very clear that you are income to Facebook, not the user level you would normally expect. Your information is sold left and right. This is not a safe app for anyone to install.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The facebook is an ongoing dumpster fire. In the past I used the facebook to sell items, for networking and to connect with old friends around the world among other things.The sad thing is the facebook has become worse and worse through the years with advertisements, methodologies for reporting/disabling accounts, accommodating the weak minded and oversensitive key board warriors (many of which either cant read or choose not to). The only thing Ive used the facebook for over the last five or so years is selling my things and you cant even sell your items anymore as there are too many buffoons that either cant read your post and cry about it or report you because they are upset that you had to explain to them everything that you already listed in your for sale post. This application has turned into a dumpster fireNever got a return email from the facebook regarding my requests and had two accounts disabled with no backbone shown from the Facebook as to why.Best of luck Mr.Z, youve lost all credibility by me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Criminal activity. Facebook is censoring, removing and/or banning those sharing critical life saving factual data which may prevent deaths and psychological damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spying us. So Facebook is collecting all the data including financial info from us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manipulation of the population. Facebook actively hides true information in an effort to control the population. If they arent blocking information outright they hide it from people on your feed. Also no one cares what you had for dinner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unsafe. Facebook Sells personal data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. I left Facebook 4 years ago when I found out that they had sold users personal information to China. Not to mention, they also manipulate what information you can and cannot see. Censorship was a problem them, and Im sure its a problem now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and tracking. Of course false information needs to be censored, but Facebook repeatedly takes down correct information. It also tracks your whereabouts constantly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disrupt Privacy. Facebook as been selling customers personal information to illegal out sources. Facebook also illegally tracks your internet browser search engine to try and track your interests Facebook should not be allowed to spy on there customers when there not using the app. Also Facebook doesnt allow freedom of speech for any Republican Party and bans people without following there own set guidelines....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Im deleting Facebook. Facebook has become way too invasive, and sells your personal information. Delete this crap basket while you can. I am.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Malicious Invasive Spyware. Harvesting and selling your data to the highest bidder. Not to mention very open to hackers. Facebook should be heavily regulated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Standards. Facebook is trash, dont let them harvest your personal information like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst for privacy. Facebook is a terrible company that steals data and sells it to the highest bidder regardless of consequences. They act like they are above the law. Apple should purge them from the App Store and congress should shut them down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new form of censorship. Facebook operates like a political entity, expressing unequivocal support for some, while hashly silencing the others. All the while you are the product. They are selling all your personal data to several brands, as well as to countries military and intelligence bodues. Liberate yourself and delete this app if you haven&#39;t aleady.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I dont feel facebook is safe anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great, Except. Facebook is a wonderful platform where you can stay in touch with family, friends and community.In exchange, you allow FB to harvest your personal information, label you a spreader of misinformation by their trusted fact checkers and then have your account deleted when you persist in sharing information that goes against the mainstream narrative. Enjoy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data stealing far-left business. Avoid Facebook altogether. Corrupt business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Toxic. I deleted the account I had for almost 15 years bc Facebook has become so toxic on so many different levels. They steal and sell your privacy, they listen to everything you say, and they are censoring views that dont align with theirs. This is anti-American and anti-freedom. I am done with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is Marxism. Tracking and storing personal information is against the law. Facebook should be sued and held accountable for its disgusting communist/Marxist ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Account deleted. Facebook should stay as a non bias platform and stop trying to control the flow of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy Issues. Before you download, look at the app privacy list Why does Facebook need to track so much I mean come on, Facebook needs my health and Fitness data and search history...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Innocent no more. There was a time when Facebook didnt moneytise your information, selling your data to anyone who asks, and now they are judge, jury and executioner on anything that doesnt fit their world view. If you must use FB use a privacy browser, a unique email account and delete your session when done. DuckDuckGo has a nice flame icon, click that and they lose their cookies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook not only holds all your information hostage and sells it, but censors what they dont like. Horrible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Harmful, toxic, and bad for your mental health. Also extremely invasive... you can be having a real world conversation and the app will be advertising things you were talking about... even after you turn off all that stuff in the privacy settings and so forth. Facebook just wants to collect and sell as much of your personal info and usage data as it can possibly get away with, while trying to censor you and tell you how to live. Do not recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook isnt safe. We are being controlled on what we can say or post, are information is being given away",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"VERY BIAS IN SHARING INFO. Facebook only shares media information which is controlled by them, it could be lies but still will share that information based politically for the agenda of their needs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is the devil. Facebook is a privacy nightmare as well as fertile ground for miss-information. Unfortunately both of those issues seem to be quite lucrative for FB which means they wont be doing any real changes to address those anytime soon. Id stay away from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data scraping garbage. If you actually believe Facebook is a social platform, you are deluded. Its an advertising platform and anyone using this app is wilfully selling their own private data in exchange for using Facebook. For example; the install size of the app is 235mb yet they store 400+ mbs of data on your device. Trackers. Top tip; if you actually want to use Facebook without the privacy implications uninstall the app and the data it stores immediately and just run Facebook in a private windows in your web browser, then the trackers are wiped after each session.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship/Disabling Accounts. You have no right or authority to decide what we see. You have no idea what truth actually is.Facebook has permanently disabled my account without a warning or as a reason why. Ive never been suspended or flagged. I wasnt given the the opportunity to fix whatever warranted my account to be disabled. 14 years of pictures, information, and memories gone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is stopping health information. Facebook is stopping information that would allow people to make informed decisions regarding their health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is Big Brother. Facebook sells your data to anyone who wants to buy it.  They spy on your private messages and sell everything they can collect.  And for that they censor you and the information you are allowed to see.  Choose Minds, PocketNet, or even Gab.  They will neither censor you nor sell your private info.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
facebook stealing your data. Mark Zuckerberg is a thief. I dont feel safe using fb anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook sells your info. Facebook uses all the data they collect from your profile and sells that info for marketing reasons. Horrible, no moral value. Company is just bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Over Reaching. After years of using FB I was asked by FB admin for personal information. Like drivers license or any government id. I dont think so the company is a hack wants way too much personal info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook treats its platform like a publisher. Information is censored off by Facebook through a loophole by using third party fact checkers which are basically paid by Facebook to censor any information that doesnt align with the official narrative mainstream media pushes. They get a bunch of regulation privileges being classified a platform, but they censor information off their platform like a publisher edits a news paper for the public safety. If Facebook was concerned about public safety they wouldnt be deleting thousands and thousands of adverse vaccine reaction testimonials from the PUBLIC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep records of everything you do. Facebook keep records of everything you do on your phone without our permission. Redonkylous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used and Abused by FB. Tired of getting used and abused by Facebook. Total invasion of privacy and collecting my data for sale. After they know everything about you and everyone else they then think they have the right to tell you what you can say or see?  Not anymore, taking everything back and moving on. May their app languish where it belongs, in the dustbins of history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy, and very discriminatory. Facebook sells my and others info to third parties. On top of that, they pretend they have fact checkers that delete and block all your info, even when its true facts They clearly have an agenda and its not for freedom and sharing info with your friends and family. Oh and theyre calling out and blocking people who are against vaccines, and plenty of other things. I havent even been on Facebook in weeks, and barely at all in months because all they do is block everyone from seeing what I share.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trash. Facebook is littered with fact checkers and political junk most the time. They listen to your conversations and sell your data to other companies. Ive deleted it, dont want anything to do with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont download. In the early days Facebook was supposed to be a harmless and fun way to stay connected with old friends. However it has become so much more then that. Its interesting that if you are chatting about certain things - holiday destinations for example - suddenly you start getting ads for that country . I cant believe the level of spying they actually do and the information they collect on you. Its quite scary just how much of our information they can collect. FB stated We use the data we have  for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our products  to personalize your experience.What the agreement actually  means is that : We will collect your personal information on and off the platform and give it to advertisers who market ads specifically for you. Unfortunately, the users are usually the last to understand this.So to me that means its running in the background even if I dont have it open - it has access to everything on my phone- no thank you I have deleted the app. I do not want an app which is in essence spying on me 24 hours a day Dont even get me started on the censoring or allowing the platform to be used by apartheid or racist organisations - my advice is avoid downloading it if u can and delete if you already have it. Having said that FB also own Insta and have been doing similar things on that platform ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invasion of privacy. Facebook continues to violate our privacy and not listen to its users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Free services come at a price. Facebook knows more about you and your friends and family then you know. Private companies are being used to track your every move, your every action, purchase, and to listen to every word that comes out of your mouth. This information is stored and used against you for profit. Your privacy is of no concern to them, just because they keep your privacy unknown to the public, does not mean it isnt well known to themselves. These companies can use your information against you, influencing your purchase behavior and even what you think. Highly recommend you delete this app to keep yourself and your privacy safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Probably going to delete it. Far too much censorship going on -Facebook are taking decisions on what we can and can&#39;t read and blocking accounts e.g. Donald Trump. Used to enjoy using Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family, but it is no longer any fun. I also have great privacy concerns about how my data is being used-I have deleted all personal information and just made up some details. Actually thinking about it I will just delete it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facist and corrupt. Facebook just sells your personal information and tells you what youre allowed to think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unsecured personal data. Facebooks history of selling personal data is reason enough not to trust this ap and company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do You Like Privacy?. If you like privacy you will delete you Active Facebook Account. Facebook sells personal data to malicious third party groups and other malicious groups.Dont use Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data tracking and privacy. There is no reason why FB should be accessing and tracking our financial information. What a scam. I hope the US Congress passes legislation to rein in these privacy violators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zuckerberg and Privacy. Facebook, lies about caring about your privacy. They exploit and use it against you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concern. Facebook started ridiculous policy updates. They now collect everything we do. They can hear us and post ads for something we said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tech support and selling your information. Tech support is horrible not to mention they allow companies to use your information. Facebook is evil on many levels but screening and filtering to their benefit is #1 priority.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unusable. Facebook is making the information available useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invasion of privacy. This app gives your personal information to Facebook and allows them to sell it to companies for profit. You get nothing in exchange.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and Data Use Issues. Unbelievable the amount of censorship and bias allowed on Facebook. Some people are censored and others are not. The platform also isnt upfront about their having bias which is very concerning. In many PROFESSIONS, we are not allowed to steer people to any particular side unless we advertise this is what we do. Seems FB has been given a pass. I hope they have no taxpayer based funding. When we leave FB, do they store our data or delete. How transparent is it that we lose rights to own on data. It is on their platform. Be mindful ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spy. Facebook sells your private data to other companies and gives all its data on you over to the government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your privacy is at stake. Facebook is a terrible company/platform. They care not about anything about money. The more security and privacy you have the less they make. Which is why I deleted my account two years ago and never looked back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. The problem with Facebook and all social media that your information is everywhere. They sell your information. And they also give the government your information.. its not about gather with friends. Your data is sold The same thing goes for Google . Listen to your Conversations and report back to there makers. A database is made. They can use this to incriminate you . Even if you havent done anything wrong. Youre signing your life away and you dont even know it. They are contracts you cant even read them. It would take you weeks to read . Even if you delete your account it doesnt guarantee the use doesnt guarantee you complete 100% delete of your data its sold . Dont be fooled. believing youre safe. Your address and phone number out there. Why do you think so many people your phone number. Think about before you sign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Facebook is now censoring what they want you to see. This is not their place to censor information and halt freedom of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing. Facebook stealing people information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pathetic The app privacy is worse than the website. Deactivate/delete your account NOW. Facebook sells your data to the highest bidder. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT. They want to brainwash you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is a Privacy Nightmare. Before installing this insidious app, go to the Privacy Section and click on See Details and read the voluminous amount of data Facebook hoovers up in order to monetize the users usage.  Facebook is patently evil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook are controlling information. Im sick to death of Facebook trying to tell me what I can and cant consider for myself.They have been tracking me across other websites, shadow banning, pushing there own agenda and opinions down my throat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Racist, stalking, selling your information to third parties. Facebook has become a horrible platform for many reasons. Not only do they violate your privacy by tracking you and your online behaviour they then sell this data to unscrupulous third parties. As well as this they have a racist view towards the apartheid conflict in the occupied Palestinian Territories. If you support Palestine and condemn the brutal killings of children carried out by the Israeli forces then you end up getting blocked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is a JOKE. They censor / they brainwash / they accept money for your personal information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero Privacy. Facebook is using everyones data in a dangerous manner and should be removed from the appstore completely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Concerns. Recently I got an email about my Facebook account being logged into. I did not log into it at the time so I was obviously reasonably concerned. However I did the privacy check and searched for log in history and there was no way to figure out who it was or how or what they did. I ended up deleting my account but also it was extremely difficult to on my laptop. I was waiting for it to load and came back an hour later to see it still loading. I had to switch to my phone and log in on there in order to delete my account. Also Im very suspicious of how people I know who live miles away happened to come across my account. I dont feel safe using Facebook. Also just another reason why: Facebook collects users data and sells it to third parties. There have been many lawsuits about this and related to for example the Cambridge Analytica Scandal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deleted my Facebook and then the app. This app is awful but thats besides the point. Your information is being sold to the highest bidder and then used against you. Will never use Facebook again. What they are doing &amp; getting away with is criminal. Delete your accounts unless you want your private info sold to 3rd partys. Bye yuckaburgh ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is selling you out. If you want to be spied on, tracked, your browsing data and location data tracked, this is the app for you. There are numerous write-ups on Facebooks awful practice of the information they collect. It outweighs the benefits of this app. Or the data breach they failed to report early, theyve done nothing about it and failed to tell users involved, you literally have to use a third party app to know if your data was breached. Facebook is not and never will be on your side. And dont even make me start on its bias towards conservatives, and threats to deplatform legitimate and factual information. In many instances they do the right thing with fact checking, but they take that power beyond its original intent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias party and concerning privacy breaches. Avoid facebook. Its only value was the marketplace and the ability to save game data. The measures they take to collect your information is concerning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Irina, Holistic Soul. It became visible clear that Facebook is part of conglomerate media and pharmaceutical companies that controls the contents and censors the truth. Its scary and threaten the freedom of speech. Where is the humanity and moral compass? I deleted FB app and will deactivate the account if it doesnt stop censoring the information we need to know. Not only that, its annoying to receive pop up ads - covid fact information or fact tracker on almost every posts via IG, FB and Google, even on every other apps, It must be removed immediately. I no longer trust their source. Information is indeed manipulated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"major limitations. Terrible app, terrible program. I deactivated my Facebook a couple of years ago, then went back in to try to download all my content before deleting. As soon as I logged back in, fb froze my account and denied me access. I have not been able to get through to anyone in customer service nor have I been able to access my account, despite numerous attempts. As a result, my info is displayed for all to see, and I have no ability to view or delete it.  I would never use their site again- its all about data-mining and advertising. Total garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STOP SELLING OUR DATA. Facebook steals your data then sells it to advertisers, this includes your location, what you look up, and what you like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why do people still use Facebook?. Everyone knows by now that Facebook collects and sells your personal data to marketers and other private entities. Facebook also censors posts that voice support for social justice movements while allowing violent right wing groups to proliferate. The company thrives off of spreading hate and misinformation. Do yourself a favor and request permanent account deletion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy breach. If you like to think for yourself, Facebook isnt for you. If you like censorship, full access to your privacy and being told what to believe and what not to believe sign up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything thats wrong with the world. Facebook uses its users in an unethical way. Collecting data and selling it for profitable gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Security Issues. Done with Facebook and any of its platforms it owns. Too many security issues and hackers can easily access your account. Facebook make it hard to retrieve hacked accounts or accounts you locked yourself out of. Facebook security is not that good in general.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No to censorship. Tired of the current trend of censorship on social media. Why does Facebook get to decide what information I have access to? If this is the direction its going Im seriously considering deactivating my account indefinitely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop it. Facebook needs to stop giving out your information or selling it to others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How much info do you need. First of it still drains your battery. Now onto other stuff. It now collecting info about you even when its offline. Thats very creepy. Second mark zuckerburge doesnt want to remove Trumps or fact-check that bastard. Zuckerburge is really support for Trump plan and simply. Facebook is full of people ( there mostly Trump supporter) that are spreading fault info. Good job Facebook you really change America with you that pig and his loony sheep. Facebook should be held accountable for the voting  by allowing these people spreading fake information in the comments.  Zuckerburge hope your reading this, America isnt the same because of what Facebook has become.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing and selling information. Facebook steals your data, including what websites youve been to, what youve searched for, etc from outside of the Facebook app. I have no issue with Facebook using the information I give to Facebook, in the Facebook app or Facebook website, to provide more efficient adds. But, I did not and do not give Facebook permission to stalk me across everything I do on the internet. Its similar to if Target had employees following me and documenting everything I do outside of a target store. Its creepy and dishonest. I will no longer be using the app, but honestly because Facebook is so anti privacy, they will create an internal profile on everything I do online anyways and sell it to the highest bidder. When will congress step in and stop websites from tracking you across the internet?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing data. Facebook is continuously stealing our data without our consent and deleting asian pages and promoting western pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook should be terminated alternatives with more privacy needed. Facebook is not platform for all people, controlled with power, serves for their benefit, share data with no consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data grabbing. Not sure how ethical Facebook is. Has own agenda, need to work out how to exit this and ensure my data is deleted fully from records.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook needs to go. I dont trust Facebook They dont keep your Information confidential. They block people from expressing their views. They are corrupt. Boycott facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Garbage. Facebook is garbage. Plain and simple. If you care about your own personal information, or your mental health, delete this app now. Dont believe me? Go look at all the info the app is allowed to share with third-parties. Did you know that Facebook leaked millions of users data and never told you. (Look it up) Still dont care? Youre an idiot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.they track you at times on are off Facebook. They censor your free speech and will put you in Facebook jail if you voice your opinion.  I would stay far away from this site. put false propaganda out to put fear in people, just a super crappy app.this site is operated by scum.they have removed the passcode access so they can dig in your account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What privacy?. Facebook has overstepped their reach with zero privacy concerns. I deleted this app and my Facebook, stop Facebook from the constant tracking and their arrogance thinking its okay and justifying it in the name of small businesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The epitome of invasion of privacy. When FB started out it didnt seem all that bad. A place to connect with long lost friends, post your thoughts, the things you liked. But that wasnt really the case, they smelled blood in the water. Rather they smelled an opportunity to make more money. The amount of data Fb takes is utterly ridiculous. What on earth do they need with all of that information? Our lives are not a commodity to be bought and sold. We are not products, we are human beings and we have a right to privacy. Dont download the app wonderful idea Oh wait FB makes a ghost profile on you if you have any friends who do have it. I dont recall agreeing to that. It truly wasnt that long ago when ads were just that, ads. No targeting, no data mining, you just got shown the ad. They made money that way, it worked, but that wasnt enough. Why make money ethically when you can abuse peoples rights and make more money? You make it extremely difficult to delete profiles, and honestly I have my doubts whether or not that data is truly deleted. That makes it essentially impossible for older people, who arent tech savvy. Facebook, much like google, is a predatory company. Its data harvesting practices are incredibly similar to what a virus would do. Dig and gather as much data as possible so they can utilize that information to best profit off the individual theyre targeting. It is utterly disgusting, and a practice I hope people will wise up to. You do not have the rights to my information, to my life, to anyones life. If youre reading this, do not download FB. Dont download messenger. You will be trading your soul for their service. You become their product. Its a company, the bottom line will always be money, not your well-being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Identity theft and fraud. Facebook allows identity theft and fraud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy, make sure to check settings. Make sure to check your setting when you download the app. By default, Facebook shares all your info. Its also such a toxic app Its not what it used to be and will be deleting everything soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues + censorship. Not only is Facebook always selling your data which is absolutely unnecessary but still does to profit from it, but they also actively delete and censor any important situations that occur in Palestine. They are doing this to contribute to Israels illegal apartheid &amp; censorship towards the Palestinians. I would not recommend this app or their other app Instagram whatsoever since both are doing the same exact thing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad business model. They track you and sell your data  with no way to opt out. Avoid Facebook products at all costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At first we all embraced Facebook.. but then the sinister became apparent. Facebook is no longer a social media platform to bring people together (if it ever was). The decisions on how they control information to make sure the public think the way they want you to is unethical and everyday that another insider blows the whistle makes me glad to have downloaded all my data, deleted my account and I have never looked back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Monitoring app. I left Facebook 6 months ago and you should too unless you want to be censored and told how to think. Their algorithms are set to shadow ban material they deem not truthful. The China fact checkers tell you how to think. And FB owns your pics once you put them up. Dont give this rich tyrant another penny. Lets talk on the phone and meet in person again, and with the people that really matter. You dont need this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook policies and culture are the worst. Its just a machine to harvest your data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User. It is totally unacceptable that fb is storing information on which apps youve been on to and its content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals my information. I would rather pay rather,than Facebook steal my information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Used by criminals. Facebook is used by criminals who take advantage of the messaging and event planning systems. They should be pulled from the App Store,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interfere with private info. Facebook constantly interfere in private business. Always pushing and soliciting rubbish to consumer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They stole my information. THEY ARE STEALING INFO AND MONEYI went on my Facebook app to the support chat to get help unlocking my account while chatting the Facebook employee sends me a 1800 number to call so I called it and the Facebook employee stole all my info from Facebook cleared my bank account *it was linked to Facebook* and blocked me out of my account I have messaged Facebook several with no response please be safe while using this app the employees are stealing information and locking people out of there account and taking their hard earned money what Facebook has been doing is highly illegal and will avoid emailing you back just know theres is criminal activity going on and if they ask you to call their support line DO NOT DO IT THEY WIIL TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook bad. They gave away my personal information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible Privacy. Ive stopped using Facebook so I that I can enjoy my life without worrying about my data being tracked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App is Compromised. Facebook collects all of your information and gives it away to others. This app is compromised and there is absolutely NO privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad for privacy. Facebook is nothing but an attempt to gain as much information from you and then sell your private data on. This is evident from Facebooks attempt to vilify Apples recent focus on giving customers an option to limit app tracking.Avoid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook pushes fake news, deboosts and hide people they dont want you to see. Facebook is an evil organization that has been caught multiple times stealing its users personal information which they then sell.  Since it has become so large (it is the de facto marketplace, communication service provider, and news provider) it is high time that it is regulated like a utility, so it cant keep pushing fake news, stealing and selling private information, manipulating elections,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scam. Facebook used your information and send it to other organisations and governments agencies No privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Its sad to see how Facebook is trading its users data with many other companies without respecting their privacy. I miss how Facebook used to be before all this drama...and I hope one day people would understand that their privacy is at risk as long as theyre using this app Bye Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and Bias. Facebook privacy settings are really bad, I deactivated my fb time and time again and fb reactivated my account automatically after one or two days of deactivation at the end I got furious and deleted the account.On another note, the political bias with certain governments and opinions and supressing the freedom of speech of one side of the story is against UN human rights.#freepalestine ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook needs to get out of my personal space. Facebook has been nothing but an irritant. They have deleted my videos, the links that I usually get information from are gone And they want way too much of our personal information. I started on Facebook to communicate with family and friends. What I have to say to my family and friends is my business and mine alone. Facebook and stay out of my businessThis controlling and censorship is un-American and unconstitutional. I have gone to other sites, grabbing my pictures from Facebook and I am deleting my account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your data costs a lot of money. Protect it, delete Facebook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook locks its users into a data harvesting service. Facebook steals data of its users without communicating where and how that data is used  and locks them into the ecosystem without any choice. For example - I own an Oculus Rift S that now requires a Facebook account to function despite the core technology being able to function without a link to the service. The Oculus app is no doubt collecting data from my PC and feeding it back into my account. I wish I could use my Oculus without a Facebook account, but the headset doesnt work without one. Im locked into using Facebook after buying a $600 product that I no longer have control over. They are no doubt harvesting data without my knowledge and selling it to the highest bidder. Dont make my mistake, dont use Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breaching Privacy. Facebook is using all of my data without my permission. Everything that Mark is doing is illegal hence he had to face the court. I do not trust Facebook with my data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lol f mark ZUCKERBERG. Look at the information that is being tracked. I now use fake information to use Facebook and deleted all my accounts Lol selll that  if you still use this after all the data that is linked to you you are DUMB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is obsolete and a waste of time. These past couple of years Facebook has gone down the tubes. Their censorship is ridiculous, my friends and family get cut off often and most of the time they dont know why, no explanation. Their fact checking is wrong, wrong, wrong, I dont know where they get their info from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not suitable for humanity. Facebook and its other platforms are more interested in selling you (your details) to maximise their profit margin. I am sure you have heard about Facebooks targeted ads that appear on your social media when you talk about things ( holidays, shopping etc) near your phone and it suddenly appears on your Facebook adds as if FB can read your mind. Well if you dont really care about all this now a few years later it will be hard for you to trace back when so many companies have your personal information and are willing to sell you things as you have been place into a sales box by Facebook. The choice is yours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.they track you at times on are off Facebook. They censor your free speech and will put you in Facebook jail if you voice your opinion.  I would stay far away from this site. put false propaganda out to put fear in people, just a super crappy app.this site is operated by scum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad. Facebook isnt safe. Its fun to stay in contact with people but they want all your information. This isnt safe. They use it and sell it and control you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook just wants to steal your info. I use a VPN to protect my privacy and Facebook continues to lock me out of my account and change my password because of it. Also Facebook hates women so -5 star if I could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is a garbage censored platform. They like to censor you and use bogus fact checkers to fact check your information you display on YOUR ACCOUNT. This platform is garbage and unconstitutional. Do research on this platform before opening an account with FB.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook actively censors information, even if it is factual, in an effort to control the narrative and curb the masses toward their own prescribed ideologies.  The executives at Facebook have been purchased and this platform cannot be trusted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issue . Holy cow. Why why why though people are still using Facebook. Absolutely horrible experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.they track you at times on are off Facebook. They censor your free speech and will put you in Facebook jail if you voice your opinion.  I would stay far away from this site. Put put false propaganda out to put fear in people, just a super crap app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship issue. Facebook has a serious pick and choose censorship when it comes to politics. There is no doubt they share private information with governments and other organizations too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lets start with. The fact that facebook released data showing personal information to undisclosed persons. They have been hacked and Ive been shadow banned for sharing my opinions. I can not get on IG (owned by Facebook) and go live because Ive been banned. I cant add anything on marketplace across platforms for some reasons. Facebook is now being exposed in the news for hurting the minds of children and mowing about it and still putting profits over anything else. Disgusting app by small hat CEO.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Restricting/Banning. Facebook is restricting and banning accounts for sharing information from their own platform.  Regular users should not be attacked for sharing content that you allow on your platform.  The originator of the material should be the individual(s) in question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Insecure. They keep asking 芦 whats on your mind 芦 But actually they already know Facebook is tracking everything: personal data from profile infos, interests, behavior and patterns and theyre selling YOU for money, making you purchase things you dont need, learn things you dont need And losing your time and money without your consent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasive software. Facebook gathers data even when one is not sign on their website. Why, what will they use this data for? Facebook censored comments made by conservative users and verified, using a company they set up, any comments made by conservatives including the President of the United States. Outrageous behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hiding and changing directions of information. Facebook now plays a very big role in delivering and giving awareness to political conflicts. However knowing they can do that they always play for one side which has been pretty obvious in a lot of cases with The Palestinean case the last of them. Facebook always tend to hide true information and dignifies them. They control what we can see which pretty dangerous, for instance you can view information that trump is winning elections in 2016 and he has very strong chance to win so people either just do not go to vote or vote for trump to go with the flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biased. Facebook sells your private information to third party companies. It tracks you and send those information to third party companies as well. It is selective and may remove your post with dictated nonsense reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy violations and ridiculous censorship. For the fifth time my account has been restricted for ridiculous reasons. I\'ve been on Facebook since 2009 and this has never happened until now, making me seriously consider leaving facebook. They\'re spying on us and censoring what we can and can\'t say. Avoid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook doesnt understand privacy. Selling your data , tracking your and their app is trash full of memes and ads , keeps exposing my Online status when Im offline on Facebook and messenger. Make messenger one app only with Facebook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They sell your information. You will get more spam and junk emails. facebook was a good idea, but now they sell your privacy. Do not download",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is stealing and manipulating everyone. Its very clear now that Facebook is stealing our data and basically our digital live to other companies and not to mention that Facebook is also choosing what to and what not to share to your eyes.And if you did your little digging you will find it manipulated a whole country before by making a civil war there and its very possible to make it again It supports killers it supports theft and its killing our normal life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Utterly disappointing. Facebook has come to the point where users are treated like commodity. Private user data which benefits Facebooks commercial interests is stolen and sold, whereas data which can potentially harm their commercial interests (i.e. criticism against governments and organisations they are biased towards) is censored. They are the ultimate spy machine in todays free world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Issue. Facebook automatically like some pages which they want (fb) from your account without your concern. This is something which should took seriously. Im leaving fb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Best Review Youll Ever Read [Truncated]. While Facebook is installed on your device, it will use the data received by Siri and Google to suggest ads. It tracks what you do, even when the app is closed, and what you do within other apps. Say youre in Credit Karma checking out loan offers for $35K. Not long after that, Facebook will send ads for loan brokers offering $35K loans. Its no coincidence that youre seeing an ad about something you sent a text message about, or mentioned in a phone call. Privacy should be more important to the end user than convenience and junk food for the  brain.Think thats bad? Windows 10 records keystrokes made. Just read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of this software. When you mindlessly click Accept or I Agree you permit this.Im not doing anything wrong, so why should I worry? - Because they create their own profile of you. What you do outside of Facebook, where you go, what you buy, etc. you know who else does this? Communist China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, privacy issues, tracking. Facebook has a bad record of censoring any person that does not agree with their narrative, even though they claim to be a platform and not a publisher. Posts are filtered, shadow banned, marked with fact-checker notices (which are dubious at best).Your data is not protected by Facebook. This is really bad and we may never know who has had access to our personal information.Facebook tracks you, even when you are not using the app.Section 230 protection needs to be removed and Facebook should be regarded as a publisher, open to liability for their heavy-handed actions against individuals who are protected by our Constitution. This is not a one-way street.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook has no sense of privacy. They keep record of anything you do while using theyre app all while saying and make it seem like they put things in action to keep your privacy. Its a lie. Also.. the only practical, good use for Facebook is the marketplace and that cant even function properly 100 percent of the time. I deleted Facebook but only because marketplace completely stopped working for me. Your app is more than broken, its corrupted with ads and intentions with my privacy isnt trust worthy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook really do be stealing data. Dont download if you dont want Facebook to figure out your entire family tree, location, hobbies, friends, etc. Also the locked out my account and wanted me to record a video of my face to get it back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete from your phone. Facebook allows scammers, and gate messages on its platform. It censors legitimate news in favour of despotic and populist political parties. Facebook makes its money by selling you the product to advertisers. Use at your own risk or delte from your phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Nothing on Facebook is secure. Read the privacy policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal info. Facebook sells your personal info to the world.  So I highly recommend staying away from it.they track you at times on are off Facebook. They censor your free speech and will put you in Facebook jail if you voice your opinion.  I would stay far away from this site. Put put false propaganda out to put fear in people, just a super crappy app.this site is operated by scum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They still track you. Even if you disable tracking in settings, and you turn off tracking on Facebooks website, they still scrub your images and your IP address and track you that way. Until Apple gives an option to remove EXIF data and obscure IP information, youre still not safe using Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invasive, Avoid at all costs. Bias party and concerning privacy breaches. UPDATE: So I had this one individual contact me condescendingly about how much he doesnt like the price at which Im selling something at marketplace and then reports me, facebook without gathering any data terminates my account. Facebook has grown to be a disease to our nation and individuality. Privacy is not respected whatsoever, the most invasive site on the web next to google.Avoid facebook. Its only value was the marketplace and the ability to save game data. The measures they take to collect your information is concerning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleting Facebook. Delete Facebook, insta and any other platform that spy on your data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship at its worst. Facebook not only violates your privicy and disperses out your information to others that you dont want to have it, its all to earn a buck for them.  Additionally their system is constantly censoring you fot opinions that they may not agree with.  When you try to contact them, its nearly impossible and they refuse to address your concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy concerns. Not only is it now one of the most outdated boring apps to have taking up storage space. Facebook deletes and hides posts that are related to justice, free speech, humanity  the list goes on. The data that is collected on you is a massive concern alone. The app needs taking down for good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is going on Facebook. I am going to keep it simple, Facebook become an unsafe place. It use to be fun place toContact with families and find lost ones, but now its all politics taking one side in most cases and playing games like facebook own us. WeEither let Facebook get all our information or maybe now we have to pay for it??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is a garbage censored platform. Zuckerberg and his cronies like to censor you and use bogus fact checkers to fact check your information you display on YOUR ACCOUNT. This platform is garbage and unconstitutional. Do research on this platform before opening an account with FB.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spying and stealing. If Facebook is stealing my data and selling it, I want a cut And do not sell my data to foreigners. I will not appreciate that . Also your fact checkers are liars, bought and paid for by the democrat Party.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is liberal garbage. They sell your private information. Dont download this crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do not join Facebook. Facebook mines and sells your data, uses information to mislead the American people and probably other countries as well. We all need to move to other less harmful apps that do abuse power. Your privacy is not respected here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why let Facebook have your data?. Quite frankly they dont deserve it. Deleted app off my phone and no longer use or need to use this app. No longer letting them make money off of me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Censorship at its worst. Since when does Facebook feel so important they can censor information. I started noticing during covid but Im sure it censored other info that I wasnt aware off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dont use Facebook anymore. It is discriminating, racist, untrustworthy, not reliable, removes free speech. Data leaks. Data is not secure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship at its finest. Facebook has been sold to the masses as a way to promote an avenue for people to socialize with friends, family and like minded individuals to share information. The kicker is, the only information that is allowed to be shared amongst individuals only works if that information fits within the box of information that Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg deems appropriate for his agenda. Anything outside of that will be shadow banned from your friends and family and in most cases posts will be flagged by fact checkers that have shown there is only one way of thinking. Their way. If you enjoy being censored and fact checked, if you enjoy not having the right to exercise YOUR RIGHT of Freedom of Speech. Then this platform is for you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How much info do you need. First of it still drains your battery. Now onto other stuff. It now collecting info about you even when its offline. Thats very creepy. Second mark zuckerburge doesnt want to remove Trumps or fact-check that bastard. Zuckerburge is really support for Trump plan and simply. Facebook is full of people ( there mostly Trump supporter) that are spreading fault info. Away ago Facebook you really change America with you that pig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your Information is YOUR INFORMATION. Make sure if you use Facebook you turn off the ability for them to track your information across other companies apps and platforms. Thank you Apple for developing the ability to stop these corporations from tracking everything we do and using our information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Blatant biased censorship and privacy issues. I originally downloaded Facebook to keep in contact with friends and family. It seemed like a great premise initially. However, there seems to be a huge number of concerns surrounding privacy and the data they share with 3rd party companies.As of late censorship has also become a big issue, as they are very biased against certain groups that think a certain way. They even ban you for sharing things on your own page. I assume its because the opinion differs from theirs. Dont even get me started on Fact checkers. That should never even be a thing. Its got to the point where not even memes are safe.Youre a social networking site Facebook. Youre not the government. Youre not the law. Stick to being exactly what you should be. A place where people can share stuff with each other and keep in contact, and stop thinking you have the authority to interfere with what we can and cannot post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy for users, Facebook is against humanity. Facebook used to be much better back in the days, nobody can post a thing now without getting banned for couple of days. Facebook is very directed right now they always find a way to shove what they believe into your face. Silencing  users will make you lose users, terrible app overall. The app always got bugs, everything is getting only worse. Time to delete Facebook app, many other apps serve the same as Facebook but 1000% times better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selling personal data. Facebook has been selling personal data to other companies to make money and it is absolutely unacceptable. Spying on Facebook users each and every move online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Is garbage. Facebook is ran by a bunch of invasive commies. They use our information without any permission. They censor people they dont agree with. An outright violation of the first amendment. FBs owner has the personality of a desert tortoise...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy censorship disabling. Facebook tracks your every move even websites on your browser, or other apps on your phone. They censor any posts and disable peoples accounts if they dont fit their extensive criteria. What do you guys think of the fact that Facebook requires you to submit a DRIVERS LICENSE OR PASSPORT for reactivation. This is a website not TSA Makes you wonder what info they want and why... I advise people to delete their accounts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No care for users. Facebook has no use or care for its users, other that idiots it can manipulate and direct lies to. It only allows one point of view its own. It fact checks the truth with invented lies. Facebook allows scammers, and hackers access to your wall; with no way to protect yourself from them or obtain remedies to stop them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is unAmerican. Facebook censures valuable information. If it goes against the Progressive Democrats it will not be tolerated.They are uninterested in any thing that goes agiant their limited value system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash. Facebook needs removed from the App Store. They violate privacy laws and the constitution. Delete this garbage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tracks your information. Facebook lets advertisers learn everything about you so they can sell your information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage. Facebook is no longer safe in any way Dont put up pictures because they are now property of Facebook and you no longer have rights (even a picture of your own child). Any information is sold about you to whoever wants to pay or it. COMPLETE SECURITY BREACH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pr铆vate information data breech. Facebooks unethical practices regarding privacy and censorship should not be tolerated.  We all keep our accounts to keep in contact with grandma.  Time to abort.  Mark zuck is a fraud and a sell out.  Hes just a front.  Educate your self.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking and censorship. Facebook is insidious and tracks your internet, selling your data. Now we hear they censor critical health information? GTFOOH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dramatic privacy concerns. Its incredible how much information and data this app will leech from your phone. Using it is a major privacy violation - and you should be mindful of this. Terms and conditions take hours to read, and they are scary. The app can access your camera and photos without your knowledge. It sends massive amounts of data to Facebook. This includes your photos, contacts, locations, messages, calls, metadata, apps, emails and phone numbers, phone usage patterns, personal and health data, website you visit, searches you make, etc. You have no control over it and no rights to your own data. This is the sold by Facebook to everyone who pays: governments, private companies, advertisers, insurers, and more. If you are not sure if you want your insurer, employer, or government to know all those things about you, avoid the app at all costs. This should be illegal...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You like being censored?. Then youll love facebook At their whim you can be locked out , no real excuse needed. Want to sell something? Well you might get denied, why ? Who knows once again at their whim. You want information abou why you cant sell or say something? Who cares ? Denied. You want all your information harvested? Welcome to facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censors. Facebook censors valuable information. There should be an open sharing of ideas and exchange of information, even IF the information is not what Facebook deems as true. Specifically, Information about vaccines. This type of censorship is unacceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias censorship. Facebook used to be good to share and discuss information freely. Now its a bias tech that censors information to suit a political or globalist agenda. They make money from secretly gathering our private information and conversations. They were used by the CIA to spy on us. Theyve lied over and over again and the CEOs dishonesty and lack of communication under oath proves this. Deleted my account in 2016 and suggest everyone do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. Facebook should not be allowed to censor information. Let people decide for themselves not according to the narrative that suits this company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook users are the products of Facebook. No privacy whatsoever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Loved it UNTIL CENSORSHIP. For those of you who live under a rock.. Facebook is a social media app. It was designed to stay in touch with your friends all over the world. Now, that being said since 2015-2016 Facebook has CENSORED and developed several Fact Checkers who reign supreme. These are independent fact checkers who certain accounts can be traced back to 2016 when they were formed after leaving CNN. Facebook has gone so far as to CENSOR the President of the United States. Facebook censors FREEDOM OF SPEECH.. but only one way. There are accounts and groups devoted to committing and discussing acts of crime against common civilians and political leaders out in the open.. however any chance Fact checkers receive.. we are blocked or muted to sending out information of an independent account says it is not true. Facebook will most definitely have lawsuits coming their way and it will be a glorious moment in history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Concerns. Facebook does not hold accountability for their mistakes , a very big dis service for those who live sensibly , many reported accounts of child abuse predators and still does not go against community standards . Upon deletion we have been asked to prove our identity through what is claimed to be a misunderstanding . There is a high concern of privacy intrusions and an extremely high risk to the most vulnerable and innocent users. Facebooks community standards do not appear and this is not challengeable due to no held responsibility . As a vulnerable person using Facebook I was horrified to see the risks posed to innocent people with no compassion or an agreement from Facebook to come to a resolution.  Dozens of reports have been made due to the risk of users and their mental and physical well being as present the risks have been ignored . Head office seems to be persistently unavailable to contact and there has been no justice nor any held accountability by Facebook for those who have been lost and endangered through social media. Passwords are NOT currently safe and urgent safeguarding needs have not been met nor have they been acknowledged through the appropriate channels and means to resolve such an issue . From what used to be an enjoyable way to communicate has now been ruined due to the lack of responsibility from Facebooks .. this app is NOT currently advised for third party witnesses also and poses a dangerous level of risk for those simply seeking communication. PRIVACY IS SEEABLE TO so many people living behind a false identity and has put thousands of people at risk simply by ignorance of the real risk and threat to Facebook and its users.  Conclusion Facebook its being urged to rethink their actions in keeping online users safe , such as age proven apps while using facebooks major app , credit approved age would also be recommended and this app to be advised to a new legal age prior to signing up with valid proof of the age of 18+  with unreachable support this app that was a well founded social interaction will now be withdrawn due to user safety concerns and the number of risks while unusable, there does not seem to be enough people unfortunately to monitor users activity nor their safety and i urge sincerely that facebooks creators to urgently recall the application under maintenance regulations. Safety is number one priority and until such arrangements to monitor I urge this app to be recalled . Upon delation deleting accounts has proven to have failed therefor putting former users at risk of such incidents at present date 17/12/21 Kind regards Former Facebook user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thieves. Facebook will stalk you, steal your data and make  money off of you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spreads disinformation. Facebook knowingly allows the spread of dangerous disinformation. They do not remove posts that violate their policies, and they dont remove posts that are detrimental to society, the environment, and democracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is garbage. facebook is garbage and this app track and steal all your information also limit your use be careful better dont download this garbage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Platform or Publisher. Facebook enjoys the protection of being a platform, meaning they are not legally responsible for what people post on it but at the same time they act as a publisher, carefully and selectively deleting, censoring and adding fact check notices the way a Publisher would. These people cant have it both ways. The fact checkers are almost always wrong, for example I was put in fb jail for stating the Covid virus came from a lab in China and months later, now we have the hard evidence that it did despite the fact checkers saying otherwise months ago. Avoid this app if you value your privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This company/app is cancer. Facebook is the cancer of social media. App or no app, account or no account, Facebook WILL track you, they will sell your data, and they will take advantage of you. It weaves its way into every aspect of your internet usage. You cant get away from it. Watch The Social Dilemma. My future kids will never have access to social media. It does nothing good for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook doesnt stop hackers from stealing your account and data. A hacker hacked my account. They changed my email address, phone number, and password. So, because Facebook doesnt have live support, there is no way for me to report my hacked account for Facebook to take down. Multiple friends have tried to help report my hacked account, but the hacker still has access to my data, photos, friends, etc. and the account is still active.  Getting my personal data stolen was not worth using this app.  Do not bother using this application and do not trust Facebook to keep your personal information private.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook steals your data. You should not allow any Facebook owned app on your phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#removefacebook#. Facebook collect my personal information include my Govt ID and still disable my account for no reason and I believe Facebook is using the method to steal people data. I want you people to Stop using Facebook.  Dont download it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Use to be pretty cool, its full of snowflakes and liberals. They use your information and put it towards ads and they Call it free, no not true you just trade data for it. You cant speak your mind using swears or youll get banned. You cant over post or youll get banned. You cant over like or youll get banned. You cant post something thats not true or guess what?? Youlll get banned. Buttt Apparently Facebook is fact checking things like the Wayfair conspiracies dumb app hands out more bans than the local mall security @WestEdm. Dont get attached to any pictures or memories because without a warning                  e v e r g t h I n g will be deleted and unable to recover. So there is exactly how Facebook works, you take the D from them or you get the D. Thanks for reading my rant. Follow me on Ig or Snapchat @TheCorruptSaint",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete_Facebook. Facebook is not neutral as some think, but it is very managed and spread its ideas and the ideas of those who finance it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ashamed to be using Facebook. You need to rewrite your policy and privacy terms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Sells Your Data. Critical pricvacy concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breach of confidentiality and imposing on free speech. Facebook is filtering and hiding information. They are brainwashing the users. They are stealing our informs  to on and listening in on us to target marketing towards us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FB has gone down hill. Interesting how Facebook can link all your personal data to everything out there leaving you wide open, but when it comes to censoring information ? They try to force their beliefs and opinions  on you that are not based on facts or science.  They rely on Google for information? Google is also owned and controlled by those with an agenda. Dont believe me? Learn how to research. Its the epitome of hypocrisy.  Facebook cannot differentiate between real journalism and hyperbole and try to force their opinions on you. How old do you have to be a FB user and yet we are treated like 5 year olds. Punishments are common for posting against their political ideologies disguised as community standards. Whose community? Not mine.   It is mind blowing how some can be fooled by the floral language. Seems like Facebook is owned by the Chinese Communist Party. So sad. Communism paints a glorious picture of living in an ideal society but history proves time and again that dictators love control, power, and oppressing those beneath  them.   If I could give negative stars, I would.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invades privacy. Facebook is a unfair social media platform which they invade everyone privacy for their benefits.I dont post on Facebook much and I always delete my previous year history. Facebook has recently reactivated a few of my posts from 2010 and than a independent fact checker used their (opinion) and reported a post I deleted 10 years ago about humanity needing each other, faith, beliefs and/or religion to move forward peacefully and I was Facebook jailed for 30 days and cant go live for 90 days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook uses your information to sell to advertising. You will be spammed and you will get phone calls and you will have an algorithm with evil people who will use any information they can to annoy you with advertising. You wont see the posts of your friends unless you go directly to their name- you will find bias misleading posts from Leftist Parties and the constituents and be told fact checkers arent bias when they completely are you will have manipulation through the posts you see and will find that FB is friendlier to those who are malicious , those who are looking to steal your information for harm, those who want to lie about a product or sell you counterfeit items You will find that the truth is suppressed by FB and they are as bad as CNN or MSNBC when it comes to what you are told is the truth. This is a site full of leftists and Karens who managed to get to the top of the FB algorithm .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data privacy. Cant wait until Apple releases the data privacy app to allow us to stop Facebook from tracking us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. Facebook is censoring information with no oversight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash. Facebook is trash. You cant speak your mind without them interfering and taking down your stuff. And the security for the peoples account are slim to none. People are hacked all the time. I was hacked and there is no live customer service to help recover. So I lost my FB account and my Messenger. Thanks FB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy Concers. I have just deleted my Facebook page which I wanted to do for the last couple of years. There is no privacy, there is no respect people who are using it but every data out there being use for commercial and political gains. Facebook, on the other hand, became outdated platform for younger generation and it has increasingly lost intellectual users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and User Tracking. Facebook tracks activity on the phone that it should not have access too and shares user data without user approval.  This is not a good app to use.On top of that they have damaged the civil discourse in the county with corporate approved censorship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook has lost its value. I initially joined FB to reconnect with friends in distant places. It was a great way to see and engage with what was going on in peoples lives, view photos, read about travels, etc. At this time however, FB has evolved into an authoritarian arm of a wanna-be socialist government, and now not only suppresses free speech among its users but also uses its platform to promote an agenda contrary to American principles. In addition, personal information is monitored and stored in perpetuity. Dont get tangled up in this web... stay free",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Facebook is like a communist run government. It is one of the reasons people in the US are so angry. They purposely censor the information that is able to be accessed. Their agenda and who they support and do not support has been made very clear. You should be ashamed of yourself. I hope you and everyone associated with you tank financially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Corrupted dirty and criminal. Facebook using their users, means us to billed up wealth and a platform to protect corrupted billionaires and politicians . To distort the truth Shame on you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used to be fun. Facebook used to be fun and free. People were able to post whatever they wanted whenever they wanted. Crazy people were allowed to be crazy, heck theyre entertaining. Now Facebook sensors everyone and everything with these fake fact checkers. This is a private company but were to the point its where people go to share information. Leave people share whatever information they want. Its not up to Facebook to decide what they should or should know. Theyre like the German Stasi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEHIND YOUR BACK. This alleged monitoring of Facebook messages is probably one of the biggest manipulations out there. People are just not aware that their communications might be looked at in this way.Perhaps even more complex though is Facebooks approach to tracking users. Recently the company announced that it would be changing its policy on tracking, and start collecting information about users activity around the web  adding this outside browsing activity to the anonymous profiles it uses to sell targeted ads.The big question is why Facebook feels the need to keep changing its privacy settings, asked Professor Woodward. It doesnt seem to do this for increased functionality or extra services, so its difficult to conclude there is not something else behind it.Part of the problem, says Chris Scott, a specialist privacy and reputation lawyer at Schillings, is that most users do not have any meaningful understanding of what terms and conditions mean. He added that most users have little or no understanding of how their personal information can be used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is taking your data. Facebook is using your data. It will drain your battery and abuse your internet usage. Do not download and do not get addicted to this app with their like button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awful invasion of privacy. Facebook needs to be regulated for their methodical and endemic abuse of user privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
App censors and collects data. Facebook censors its users. Facebook also collects your private information and sells it to third parties.  You really have to understand the level of corruption when using this app.  Facebook is not neutral and involved itself in politics and attempting to sway public opinion. This is not just a fun app but dangerous to the public.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad in terms of privacy and freedom. Facebook shares my info for advertising porpoises,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I feel that Facebook is not safe. I think Facebook collecting information on me and my family and turn around and sell it to third party , am staying away now from fb and happy with my new app .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I deleted Facebook when I felt like my information was being used and viewed without my knowledge.. its also hard to delete which freaks me out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Facebook has become too useless and threatening for our life.Too much involvement in peoples private life will cause major decrease on their reputation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sales your personal info to China. Facebook wants your personal information so they can sell it to people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook should be shut down. Absolutely thee worse with protecting acts. There is no one to talk to if account issues occur. U get put in FB Jail for EVERYTHiNG. If you have a business and have business pages connected it can absolutely effect your business when trying to reach your customer base on FB. It def needs a revamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete Your Account. Facebook tracks everything you do, and stores everything about you, then sells it for obscene amounts of profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FCc. You are not allowed to track personal details on our accounts. I am reporting facebook and all the requests to review things that don't work.  I hide things and it doesn't work, disable doesn't work basically Facebook is old and nothing works goodbye FB done had to give a star or it wouldn't post. I would give negative 500000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data sharing and biased views. Facebook shares all your data with 3rd parties and they allow to publish biased opinions (post-truth politics) about certain people which they deem to be appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Completely Policed and Suffocates Freedom of Speech. The only benefit Facebook still has is connecting with friends and family I know closely. Other than that, they use their algorithms to tag normal factual things you post or say regarding current topics as false or requiring fact checking if they are contrary to Facebooks agenda. The few good things it provides are severely outweighed by all the toxic fear-mongering topics that are shared in accordance with Facebooks agenda. And good luck if you have facts or opinions that contradict this agenda youll be labeled as a false information spreader. Facebook is doing nothing but stressing people out and causing them to become more polarized and divided than ever. Shame on you, Facebook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook = goodbye privacy. Normalize data dignity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook. Facebook is using your info to try and control everything you have access to . We are losing our liberties to these big tech companies.  Wake up America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook. Facebook is using your info to try and control everything you have access to . We are losing our liberties to these big tech companies.  Wake up America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cant trust Facebook. Stop selling our data to third parties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. Constant breaches of privacy which has been the long running case of Facebook. Do not trust a word this company tells you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash. Facebook loves to take all your information and sell it to the highest bidder.  This platform is corrupt and dying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censored information. Facebook used to be about unity and now its just censored garbage. The ads they run are way too intrusive and your data is not safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shame on Facebook. Your platform was meant for individuals to share info with one another As long as it is NOT illegal, it is not your business what they want to share. Blocking, removing and censorship is not the American way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook Is Useless. Facebook is no longer a useful app/social media platform. If you want to lose your personal privacy, let someone else decide what you are allowed to say, and have someone dictate what you are supposed to like or support, then by all means sell your souls Facebook and keep your account. If you want to have a mind of your own, and be allowed to have an opinion on anything in this world, steer clear of this company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues and unequal enforcement of rules. The only thing I like about Facebook is that it works....that&#39;s it. Over the two years Facebook has enforced it rules but unequally. Most of the time they will enforce one side of the political spectrum more and enforce the other side substantially less (it&#39;s obvious). Facebook is the model for bad privacy settings and rules, they give you very little control over your personal info on the app and website which in my opinion should be illegal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Americans information leaked. Facebook is selling our information. To companies trying to use it against us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Mess. Facebook does not respect your privacy at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its trash. Ive been a user Facebook for several years now Im actively trying to deplatform myself from Facebook. Its abundantly clear how biased they are towards individuals and groups that they disagree with. They sell your information to groups that do not have your best interest in mind. All the while they milk their section 230 exemption and pay millions to make sure they doesnt get taken away from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gps For Your Life and Voice. Censoring anything that doesn&#39;t conform to the agenda that Facebook feels is pertinent . Tracks pretty much every key stroke, website, text and phone call. If they cant make money from it, then its wrong and banned. Facebook became a political monopoly and isnt even close to what it was when first started. It no longer cares about connecting people, only controlling them. As soon as i can save my old pictures Im done with facebook. Which in itself is so hard to really delete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deep State Cabal. Facebook is a biased, Communistic and Gestapo type of social media platform. They dont like the truth. Their fact checkers will suspend you for the truth. They support homosexuality/transgender movement. They prefer crooked politics and lies over what is the truth and what is right. Very sick, demented and demonic platform. If you try to close your account they wont let you. They prefer to keep it open and sell the number of people on their app if not perhaps also sell your info. These people cannot be trusted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In social social media. Facebook has not lived up to my expectations, they are censoring so much information its not really worth having to obtain a rounded view of things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fake news. Censorship. Unethical business practices. Facebook is no longer about community or relationship building. The company lost my respect due to ethically censoring important information. Not worth being apart of any longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook censors and fact-checks information that can save peoples lives. Facebook bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross privacy invasion. Just look at the privacy label at how Facebook tracks you. Theyre literally selling pieces of your personality to advertisers to sell you stuff. Uninstall and dont look back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook controls your personal data. Facebook continues to blatantly take users data and use it to target ads, and posts towards them.Facebook is useless because of its non-stop ads between every personal post. Facebook continues to claim that we have to place ads within the apps in order to keep the platform free. Honestly, theres more ads than you could shake a stick atI cannot stand the blatant lying from its CEO. During the 2021 Outage, he said that we apologise for the disruption in connecting to people you care about  Dont be so stupid, he knows every Facebook user is just scrolling through because their bored, not that theyre actually connecting to someone they care about. Im sick of lies and as far as Im concerned, Mark Zuckerberg needs to goFacebook was once a thriving platform used for genuinely connecting to the people you care about. Since then, its become an appaulling excuse that steals your data, and makes a lot of money.Avoid Facebook at all costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook = societal cancer. Goodbye Facebook. You have gotten as much of my personal info as youre going to get. You dont care about user privacy. You dont care about your users because youre worried about stealing their private info so you can sell it. Zuckerberg and the rest of the people who run Facebook are soulless. They sold their users out for a buck. Thats all it was ever about. A way to make Zuckerberg and his co-conspirators rich. Well now they are rich, so starve the beast of users then let them go away and enjoy their wealth. Ethics, morals or virtue have no meaning to Zuckerberg and his cronies. Im done helping Facebook make millions of dollars with info stolen from its users. Im ending my account with them.Edit: I would also like to add that Facebook and Twitter were the social media apps used to plan the Capitol riots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Propaganda and censorship. Only one narrative is forced down the users throat about any circumstance and any alternative information is blocked, deleted and censored to further reinforce their narrative. Facebook is no longer a social media site it is an indoctrinating programme and its sole purpose is to influence and corrupt the minds of the user to believe whatever they want the user to believe. Facebook was once an enjoyable platform to talk to friends and keep in touch with relatives from but that is now a distant memory as it is now just a platform promoting toxic propaganda and misinformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook exploits your privacy and monetizes it. Got off FB and every other social media ever since discovering their disgusting exploitation of privacy even when not using the apps. Good riddance and you should do the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ur security is at risk the second you create an account. Sooooo terrible I cant even explain it all on here. Look at Reddit and hear what the real people deal with when it comes to Facebook. Facebook is nothing more than a data hacking unsecured piece of trash leech that is filled with scammers and bots who at any point and steal everything piece of ur information. Even if you delete ur account a hacker can deactivate at anytime even years later and steal all ur info and message everyone you know. Theres no customer support whatsoever. Its insane this company even functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bias censorship. Facebook used to be good to share and discuss information freely. Now its a bias tech that censors information to suit a political or world economic forum agenda. They make money from secretly gathering our private information and conversations. They were used by the CIA to spy on us. Theyve lied over and over again and the CEOs dishonesty and lack of communication under oath proves this. Deleted my account in 2016 and suggest everyone do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing data. Facebook is the cause of all my cross data privacy issues. A week after installing, my privacy was slowly leaked relating to what I do in my browser.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bad business practices. Everyone should report Facebook to the BBB for bad business practices regarding their advertisement system. They allow business pages to share your info on a list that they have illegally obtained. With no way to remove yourself from these lists. Then of you block so many they restrict you from blocking advertisers, and then restrict even further by not allowing you to hide them while allowing even more businesses to add more lists of your info that was illegally purchased. They need to be held accountable like any other business. We agreed to their community standard and rules, not to be exploited and allowed to be illegally shared our info.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Totalitarian control and invasion of privacy. Facebook is a terrible platform  which sensors truth and promotes lies and propaganda. Its operating system invades every aspect of your phone and steals your data as well as accessing and storing your offline activity. DELETE THIS RUBBISH OFF YOUR PHONE FIR YOUR IWN SAFETY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data compromised. I dont trust Facebook to not steal my data, but its useful for networking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete your account. Fictional fact checking, politically biased, and a plethora of data breaches. Delete your account and kill the divisive societal cancer that is Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook censors and controls what you can post and what information you are allowed to see.  Also, they use fact-checkers to block content that does slip through, even if the fact-checkers do not have accurate sources to back up their claims.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Criminal. Facebook is partisan and criminal in their use of information, blocking of conservative participants, information provided by their fact checkers which is false, and many other items.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible. Facebook not only steals and stores all of your private information, but it also curates news for you, making decisions about what you are allowed to see or know. They are actively hiding the truth about many topics to promote some hidden agendas.Boo, Facebook, boo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No worth the time. The way the data is being used by facebook, the restrictions impose to the usuarios FB is just an app that takes space out of my techs...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great App for social stuff and marketing but. They keep finding new and interesting ways to collect your information. Now they can track your actions in other apps even if facebook is not running. Facebook can now collect information from other apps even when not in use. That information can include your name and exactly what youve clicked on. I dislike this very much but i still use the app because my business is linked to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Carefully read Facebook data collection practices (located under app info). Facebook is destroying society.... and the data that they collect from you when you download and use this app should be criminal  Zuckerberg is an egomaniacal sociopath with no ability to feel empathy for the billions of people he negatively impacts, nor remorse for the horribly predatory ways he has used our private information. Save society &gt; Delete Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals your data to make money. You are their product and they make money out of you. It should not be Facebook it should be called .. you know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FB uses you. FB seemed like a harmless social interaction app but the more I used it the more I saw the truth. It gathers all the users personal information-looks at it statistically and sells it to advertisers. This banks billions of dollars for FB owners. Its disgusting. This app force feeds its users political bias, bombards them with personalized advertising and censors any post they dont approve of. I permanently deleted my account-so I hope - and Im boycotting anything to do with FB and Zuckerburg. Now days its not so much where you spend your money- but its more about where you invest your attention. I WILL  NEVER SUPPORT FACEBOOK. I hope it dies out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Issues. Facebook is not allowing reasonable discussions that allow people to share concerns about many important issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleting this app due to censorship. In my opinion, Facebook has continued to manipulate the availability of information and has intentionally and inappropriately censored content in an attempt to manipulate public and political opinion. Im tired of trying to read information from legitimate sources, only to have FB censor it or put warnings on it, or try to redirect me to other information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You are the advertising. Facebook is selling your data to large corps for marketing... we are the product that is being sold, not the advertisements that you see on your feed. Better getting away from Facebook sooner than later, but at this point they already can potentially have all the info they need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook-Cops. I thought my account was private unless search warrant of course, but  government officials can get your data this includes erased content as well without you even knowing.  basically dont say or do anything that would jeopardize you or family on it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook controls content and fails to protect data. This is a social media platform that acts as a publisher, controlling what we are able to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy is trash. All facebook does is steal your info out the butt, they threaten us iOS users of charging us if we dont let them take our personal info from the shadows. Zuckerberg is a scum bag and Im thankful for Apple strengthening our security across software. #PutAnEndToFacebook",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censoring. Facebook should not be censoring truthful info. And shutting down accounts for people telling the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Propaganda and selling your details. Facebook is now just a propaganda platform intended to silence the majority. Fact check that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy , the rich controlling us as usual. Facebook has the power to do so much to help poverty , health and displacement. Instead it censors us and invades our privacy . We have no privacy or Freedom of movement right now. They want us to buy things we dont need to keep their pockets fat. Terrible.  Enough is enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh Boy. Let me start this off with the fact that Facebook listens to you. Without your consent. They do this to recommend ads that meet with your preferences. There have been lots of studies proving it to be true. Also I have heard speculation of Zuckerberg having the legal ability to sell your personal information. So download at your own riskIf you can get past those nasty gripes with the platform its pretty shittily put together. The biggest problem that I have is the lack of customer service. If you have an issue with anything on the platform, good luck finding a way to open a support ticket. Beats me. Ive been banned three times now on the same account for posts that dont even resemble policy breach, and there was no appeal. Eventually, I deleted the app because of how annoyed it was becoming. Since then Ive decided to use Facebook more for a shopping experience. The marketplace is honestly a great tool for finding local junk that you dont need, but impulsively buy anyway; which is the only reason that I am giving this app anything more than one star. Other than that the platform is full of toxic pc subcultures that will do anything in their power to destroy you even if you slightly offend them. In conclusion, if you download this app, take percussions to protect your information, dont get banned, use the marketplace when you cant find an item anywhere else, and tread carefully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
False information and punishment. When Facebook open this they knew what could happen do after all this years of ups and downs Facebook still the same fogata where u put wood any kind and will get bueno matter what in any way possible they locked accounts they take away profiles responding to demands usually made by corrupt car谩cters organizations and more when the truth isnt good for them they come to Facebook police and they do everything to silence us you me and  more but when a crazy post what they do Facebook celebrates them .

NO REGARD TO PRIVACY. facebook has no regard to our privacy. period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Political censorship. Instead of continuing to act as a neutral arbiter of information, Facebook has imposed its own preferences, downgrading particular stories and upgrading others, suspending certain accounts while maintaining others.  The dishonesty of marketing a biased outlet as an unbiased platform has significant consequences for American politics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and tracking- dangerous and useless. Facebook is about the biggest waste of time ever.Unless you just like scrolling photos of other peoples life, this platform has no real purpose.You cant post facts, you cant share your own opinion......oh and they track absolutely every single thing you do.Facebook deserves to lose their protections under the US government for what they do to their users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No privacy. Facebook used to be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, share pictures, opinions, your stories with whoever you wanted to.  Now its becoming a place of censorship and control, taking away freedom of speech while happily collecting your data to bombard you with unwanted advertising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The more time goes on, the less usable fb becomes. Facebook used to be the best place to connect with others but has become anti-user and the data tracking/selling of your information has gotten very extreme. Its false information is back and forth as well and very inconsistent. Hopefully it changes for the good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook doesnt care about privacy. They never cared from the beginning of this company. This country is worse off because of Facebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are deleting accounts and monitoring your personal information. I have more time without Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Facebook are made it easy to steal people privacy. It is creepy because they can spy on your websites. Moreover, they hand the info to a third and fourth parties ...etc. It is all about business and we are for sale by the company. Shame on Facebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sells your information even after turning off. Facebooks a scam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook facilitates lies and disinformation. Facebooks unwillingness to fact check lies emanating from Trump and other powerful political leaders makes it a platform for lies and disinformation. I cannot in good conscience keep my account. Good bye Facebook and Zuckerberg. I hope regulation is coming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data hog and inappropriate censorship. I dont trust Facebook and find it to waste so much battery life. Also whats the deal about inappropriate censorship of freedom for certain people and needing access to data across apps. Right now super low trust in this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy is something Facebook needs to seriously consider. Details got compromised via facebook. They deleted some of my posts for no reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zero Privacy. If you want your information sold to the highest bidder then download Facebook.  Always changing the privacy settings and not letting you know.  Use something else for Social Media.  Facebook is a fraud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Criminals Playground. I no longer feel safe to use this appConsidering the criminal activity that has been reported, yet facebook does NO THING about itAnd on top of that, They want my permission to track, and sell my information, so they can advertise to meThe only way I will agree to anything of that sort is if Facebook agrees to pay me the money they make off of my informationUntil then Facebook better check themselves before someone with the know how checks them, cause I personally will be attending thatvtrial, and will probably get contempt for cheering on their enemiesGO APPLE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cance Facebook. I hate Facebook and never use it it wants to much personal information like why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop Tracking My App Data. I request Facebook to adhere to privacy standards and not steal my data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Going out sad. Facebook, among others, censors the truth/news that world needs to know. Uses data tracking &amp; data sharing tech unbeknownst to most users. Its like privacy is nothing more than word.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taking control of my data. Tired of you profiting from my information. Facebook isn&#39;t what it used to be and is littered with ads. Keep your platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beware of Censorship. Facebook used to be a great app to get in touch with friends and family no matter where they lived.  Now, it has become a political nightmare.  It censors everything and prohibits freedom of speech.  Somehow my account that I had since 2009 was hacked and they shut it off saying I had to prove my identity.  After sending in my ID, they said I wasnt an emergency so they wouldnt deal with it right now due to COVID.  That is Bull  Its just an excuse to censor peoples accounts and shut them down if they dont like what they have to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Facebook has NO right to censor information. You are NOT the thought police.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infringement upon your freedoms. They sell all your personal data to the government and for profit. They silence you and they flag your posts based upon political affiliation. They label something as fake news whenever they are really the fake news. I cant wait until a new app developer who respects freedom of speech and data privacy comes along. Facebook is humanity at its worst in the cyber age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is disinformation. The free flow of information is not allowed on this platform, go to Parler if thats what you desire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are taking your data for a ride. Facebook does not care about you. You are just another object in a database with a $ value assigned to your data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FACEBOOK STEALS YOUR INFORMATION. BEWARE FACEBOOK IS LOCKING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING YOUR INFORMATION NO WAY MY ACCOUNT GOT HACKED. AND ALL MY FRIENDS LIST ARE 35 PPL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Increased censorship & invasion of privacy. Over the last few years Ive continually seen how Facebook invades our privacy. Now over the last two years its become apparent that they block, censor and delete anyone or any POV that doesnt fit their narrative whilst not deleting accounts which promote violence etc I can no longer support this company / app. Ive deleted it from my phone as well as messenger. I will most likely delete my account as soon as I make sure to not lose any contacts/friends. Unless they make serious changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and stealing data. Facebook censors people from telling the truth whilst simultaneously stealing data about you and friends and passing it on to gain more power and riches. The censorship is probably the most vile thing of all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is crap. Facebook is not just content to make money off you by selling your information, they also want to control your mind as well as censor your opinions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prior user. The exposure to big data and its intrusion into our personal lives is a significant risk to the individual and general population. The value and benefit of the site are not worth the risks and for that reason I deplatformed from facebook permanently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is a theif. They steal me data Arghh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weaponizes attention and sells your data. Facebook was designed to manipulate its users by feeding them biased content in an endless feed. They sell your information to anyone who will pay them for it. You are being watched. Delete the App and look into decentralized social platforms like Mastodon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seal your data and allow foreign interference to steal your accounts. FB should be broken up and sued for the amount corruption they allowed.  My account been compromised constantly by foreign accounts and spam.  I cant wait until they get a huge fine or lawsuit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook use to be about friends and family. Facebook use to be about friends and family staying connected. Now it is all ads and BIG TECH babysitters. You arent allowed to really speak your mind in fear of FB jail, that is if you lean to the right. Facebook was important to me in the past, but I can live without it, I know so many people that will not ever use it again. I am at the point were I can take it or leave it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Facebook are continually censoring truthers out there who know whats really going on with this pandemic and we know theyre using peoples personal data without our knowledge or consent. Shame on you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage censorship. If you dont align with facebooks ideals they will censor you. Get off this garbage and stop letting them sell your info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid. Facebook collect your personal data. They use fact checks deemed independent yet are owned by themselves. The app itself is a breeding ground for toxicity and hate speech.  Plenty of more things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No data protection. Facebook is happily selling everyones data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing info. Aside from stealing personal data and gaining access to it without my consent its a glitchy and terrible app that doesnt work without causing extreme battery drain for my phone. I am deleting Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thought police. If you say or do anything on here, Facebook has rights to it. Be prepared for your account to be censored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Off-Facebook Activity is stealing our data. With a recent update, the Facebook app now monitors what were doing in other apps on our phones so they can sell our data to advertisers. THIS IS INSANE. I use Facebook to keep up with friends and family, not to be spied on OFF THE APP for the companys profit. This is not okay and needs to end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your Data is Not Secure. I would not suggest downloading Facebook. Within a matter of just a couple of days, many of my friends had their Facebook hacked with a successful login. I also received a sketchy email offering me a job because they were able to back door my email and other personal information. I will be deleting my Facebook within the next couple of days. All of this happened while this platform promoted National Data Security Day. I am disgusted and disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your personal information is opened for sell. Beware, you are like a sell cow in catalog, and facebook selling all information and doesn't care you anymore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concerns. Facebook blatantly tracks you profits from your information. Constant annoying ad make is difficult to navigate through the app without interruptions.  terrible service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship. Facebook has been in a constant decline. They are continually taking more and more of its consumers information and selling it. They monitor and track everything you do on their platform and other platforms. They work together with other social media platforms to share information about conservative and right leaning posts. They routinely block post that do not fit their political views. Your political views should be no less important than Facebooks views are. Facebook should be a non biased free flow information platform. Their actions in the past few years should be cause for a class action lawsuit by every person in the world who has been censored and the judgement should be so severe that it causes the shutdown of Facebook. Dont waste your time or life to this corrupt company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is criminal. They are fraud and need to be exposed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Disgusting Policies. Facebook tries to force these apps down your throat if youre trying to do anything utilitarian on the platform. They want to own as much of your time and data as possible. I cant stand it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Censorship and data harvesting. Worst app out there as it sinks its teeth into all my other apps and then shares all my personal data with the highest bidder. Also I can even share pertinent information through messenger or on my wall without the information getting censored. How does Facebook have the right to tell me what I want to share with my friends and family?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Avoid at all costs. Facebook should be avoided at ALL costs. Under the surface, they are a tyrannical organisation who are harvesting all of your personal information, contacts, photos with the sole aim of using this information to help develop systems, laws and rules that will work against us. They interfere in elections and sway voter behaviour. They also have sinister algorithms that can create and nurture racial, homophobic or nationalistic tensions. Please do your research and avoid Google as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy is Nonexistent. I am hoping to see Facebook broken up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disgusting data farm . Facebook just wants to milk as much data out of you as possible. Theres no alternative to their services, until they get broken up by government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wont let me download it again after I uninstall it for some lagging problems. So Ive had Facebook in my phone for like more than a year now(since I got a new phone last year),, and now September 2021,,I uninstalled it because it was lagging for some reason which I really dont know what is,,and when I was about to install it again,,it leads me to paying billing forms or stuffs like that which really never happened before when I uninstall the app. Hope u guys do actions in it ASAP or Ill never get to have Facebook forever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is now the ministry of information. Facebook is no longer a trusted platform for people to just share their lives and help others.  It has been heavily politicized and has banned hundreds or thousands of people for sharing legitimate information and important opinions on important topics of public debate.  They hide behind fact checkers, policies and misinformation to control and purge any ideas that dont conform with politically correct idealogy.  Its a sham and a danger to society and everyone who works there should be ashamed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing info. Facebook has been caught red handed handing out info what does that make you feel about the app?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolute breach of privacy. Facebook logs me into another persons account using my log in details. Ive tried contacting them but no reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Read what info they collect on you before you download. The amount of data Facebook collects on you is terrifying Ive used it for over 10 years now and I never realised this Totally not worth me finding out what a high school ex friend is doing these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook and blatant censorship. Do not get sucked into this social media application. Once you are connected to family and friends its difficult to leave. Facebook has its own agenda that it accomplishes through censorship of posts. In short, your account is NOT your account and will never be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gate keeping information. Facebook used to be about making connections.  Now its about censoring certain values and beliefs, and promoting other values and beliefs that they align with since it lines their pockets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No longer a fun way to stay connected. Facebook constantly censors its members and finds ways to sell/share their personal data.  Theres always a new hoop to jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy at all. This app try everything to get my personal information as much as possible It prevents me from completely log out Hope there will be another app that will replace Facebook for good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you can avoid it Keep this away from your phone. The app itself is constantly updating, takes a huge amount of storage and changes every five minutes. Its almost impossible to use organically as a small business or community or charity and the recent fact check stuff is so wrong its unbelievable. Facebook lie to you on a daily basis. They take your money with no return. Cover your feed with things you dont care about and spread misinformation widely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Facebook is no longer a place to share information.  They are presenting biased information, keeping citizens from having open dialogue.  I feel Facebook is coming to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid if possible. Do I seriously need to tell you whats wrong with Facebook? Please take the time to research their information stealing policies and garbage moderators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biased platform and a spying organization. Facebook is spying on you without your consent. Even if you remove all the permissions from app, it still spy on you. Its also an islamophobic and biased organization. Facebook force you to stop raising voice for Muslims. It is brainwashing people by allowing only what they think its right. Shame in mark zuckerberg. Shame on Facebook ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fb is nothing but an app for add and tracking data. Facebook need to care for their users more , their apps are getting slower and dumper every time they update it, they only maintain more adds functionality and track you down in more ways, not good user experience no better performance and no security",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deletes your content, puts you in FB Jail. If your looking for censorship and propaganda, Facebook is just for you. This app needs to be taken off",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Severely bias and has political agenda. This is not surprising because Facebook in the past had been known to leak user data in order to advance political agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Poor service. Facebook is censoring everything you do or say, collect personal data and selling it to who knows who.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Profits over privacy. Facebook are an evil company that are primarily driven by greed and power. They sell their users attention as the product. Way too many advertisements and way too many left leaning fact checkers. Facebook is not a safe place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prepare to be told what to think or say. Facebook used to be a place where we all came to hang out with friends, share funny videos, vent, or share information. Now, the only information allowed to be shared is what matches up with the what the media is spewing. If you dare do your own research and post something contrary to the agenda, their fact checkers will, at best, slap a fact checker label on your post to attempt to discredit it, or at worst, completely censor you by not allowing you to like, comment, or post anything for a certain timeframe. We called it being in Facebook jail and a lot of us spent quite a bit of time there. Well, no more. I, and millions of others, have left the platform for uncensored platforms such as MeWe and Parler. So if you like being told what youre allowed to think or speak, Facebook is the app for you. If not, dont waste your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook blows. Mass marketing machine not a place for friends anymore. Collects metadata from everything you look at and sells the data out. No privacy at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They censor your content. Facebook used to let people post what that wanted but they decided to use their platform to censor information to give an advantage to the political left.  The blatant disinformation being peddled by their so called fact checkers will be the end of that platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship. Its unAmerican the way Facebook controls information. I understand its your company, your rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Facebook is not a good platform to use. Stay away no privacy and its not good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible security. If you change one of your personal details on Facebook, you will be locked out of your account and need to answer a few questions. But Facebooks need is stupid as even if you add pictures of all your ID, nothing will be accepted. So if you get locked out and get asked for ID, you can say goodbye to your account. Please change this, Facebook. ASAP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Theyre trying to control you. Facebook literally has stacks of information about your life, has access to all of your data, and sells it for profit. Not a secure space if you ask me. Privacy does not exist with an app like this. Your also blinded from objective content because Facebook just puts biased material on your feed. Theyre trying to control the way people think freely. People need to wake up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disappointing privacy and marketing policies. While the Facebook App is technically sound, and visually acceptable, the underlying policies of the developer and their organization are something that each user MUST be very careful to consider before using this App. While the usefulness of having quick and easy communication with friends, family, and acquaintances, it comes at the cost of giving up all of your personal information for advertising and marketing purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leaked my information. Facebook leaked my information.. I had to delete my old account and make a new one because FB informed me my information was given out, I will never be able to trust this app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Identification Requirements. Why does Facebook request/require a government ID?  And in the fine print suggest they share info for up to 30 days with trusted partners.  I deleted my data and this app 5 years ago and returned only for the marketplace.  So much for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Should be criminal activity. Blatantly tries to steal your user data to seek for a profit. Im not saying other websites dont do the same, but Facebook goes farther and acts more entitled than any other group/company I can think of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ill be the judge of what I want to see. Facebook has decided that they will be the arbiter of the information that I am able to see. I dont need their help and have made it 50 years without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals too much information. The Facebook app collects websites and other apps you use on your phone and stores the information on the app. God knows what else it can read or pick up and every time I have talked about something or searched it on google, Ive had an advertisement for it. It 100% listening to you without you knowing as Ive spoken to people about without putting it into my phone and minutes later Ill have an advertisement for it. Its a joke and wont be using it anymore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Help me understand. Why do I need to provide my card information to redownload Facebook? I dont make purchases from it so why does it need my account information to login???,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I ended up uninstalling the app. It was like a walk in the park, but once Ive notice how Facebook maintain online ALL the data I once erased (even from my PC), I decided to uninstall the app. And it makes hard for me to connect with people since many friends are on FB, but I rather keep my personal data safe and storage where I decide, rather than realising that is not under this social network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shady Platform that Censors Accounts. Facebook is a shady platform that censors political dissent that is not in line with corporate, imperial America.You are better off deleting your account and using a different social media platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship and tracking ethics violators. Facebook will censor and/or delete posts that dont follow the mainstream media narrative. Even if it doesnt violate the terms you agreed to theyll bend those terms and then punish you for it. With every app update there are new user settings which are added or get reset which changes how your personal information is viewed or accessible by others. Your data and location also gets used without your knowledge as a default setting unless turned off. Even if turned off, is it actually off?The app crashes, the fact checkers do whatever they want without being checked themselves, and FB is a poster child for censorship and indoctrination. There is a difference between hate speech and speech that you hate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook Should Be Heavily Regulated. Please write your Congressmen to ask that Facebook be broken up and heavily regulated due to suppression of First Amendment rights to free speech (eg suppression of conservative speech) and misuse of personal data. And they should pay reparations for all their privacy violations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is going downhill fast. What on earth is Facebook doing to us?  Watching what we say, hiding what we post or what we get from our FB friends.  Im being constantly asked to give more and more personal details when I log in. Why?  I have one of the top Malware/security software on my laptop.   This incessant security questions lately, is it to protect me or steal my details?    I saw a video online yesterday that shows Zuckerburg is being questioned by the US Senate to confirm/admit from investigations that he is colluding with Google and Twitter to monitor what we do on those accounts too.   Wow.  Be aware people.   Since the pandemic, it feels like its getting suspiciously totalitarian.  Im not liking it at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is a tracking system. Facebook has become your worst enemy  Not ONLY do they censor and fact check things to death, they record every single reaction, comment, etc....  Hmmm...  After being a member since 2008 I deleted the app as they have far too much power and it has become a political machine by design.  I didnt feel safe from Facebook anymore  That is a problem....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is not what it used to be. I originally joined Facebook in 2007 to stay in touch with my high school friends. Since then, many have left Facebook and we barely use this app - posting about your personal life for likes and attention is sad. Adding to that, tracking user data 24/7 without consent, affects on mental health and the blatant/ignorant censorship of personal + political viewpoints = time to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No worth time to spent. As soon as Ive installed I did remove the Facebook app when it asked me to confirm and agree to terms and conditions where they were asking to give them permission to all data. Sorry, but NO recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stupid rules. Facebook is a piece of s-h-i-t You deserve to be deleted, stealing people privacy and block their accounts unfairly is your job If there is an option not to rate a stars that will be better For example: Ill choose crushed tomatoes as a sign of rating. Im waiting to see you closing this s-h-i-t :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beware. Facebook sells your data and censors people that they dont agree with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No privacy. I wouldnt download useless you want to be tracked by Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F Facebook  violating privacy. Facebook decided they want to keep track of all of activity on or offline and even if you turn this off they still keep collecting info . WhyMark zuc you are sick creep Get a life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy exposure. I advice every Facebook user to delete the app and deactivate their account. I just found out that so many people private messages and pictures are being monitored by the administration. I saw my naked videos and pictures in a database since I started looking into it. A word for the wise is quite sufficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Censorship, exploitation of personal info, biased factchecking and propaganda. Facebook is the most outrageous social network platform engaged in shameless censorship, totally biased factchecking, control of information and mass propaganda. Furthermore they use all your personal information and act as a big brother. Its very sad that it has come to this. I have removed my FB profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook review. Unethical low lives who pray on free speech and those who voice their opinions freely.Facebook factcheckers paid by big pharmaceutical and communists. Im in process of issuing legal notice withdrawing any and all consent for Facebook to take my data and use it. First notice already issued may 1st and uk data protection act will be basis for law suit and criminal prosecution if my data has been collected/sold or used by Facebook or any linked 3rd party to Facebook from the 7th may 21.Foia issued 20/5/21TICK TOCK ZUCKER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Harmful. I do not appreciate Facebook giving private info from our lives and data to third parties, this is a violation of privacy and respect. This is just shameful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Malware as a Service. Entire business model of this company is to steal as much private info as possible and sell to 3rd parties. Facebook is circumventing Apple privacy controls by scraping EXIF data data from photos. Company and its apps are a danger to your mental health, sanity and safety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Now that Apple shows us all the data Facebook takes from us and sells its ridiculous... App Deleted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your details become Facebooks product. Privacy is none existent on Facebook they used all your details and sell it its just wrong absolutely disgusting there is no free speech on this platform its about time we take away there power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook is untrustworthy. Facebook is a data mining thief that sells your personal information to the highest bidder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FB DOES NOT WANT TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY. FB will do anything they can to get all information on you and sell it. They make it impossibly difficult and confusing to change your privacy settings. Its laid out that way so most people (especially the older crowd) cant figure out. Much better social media apps out there. Use something else FB is dead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy issues and data collection not trustworthy. This app stores your location info, facial recognition from photos, and even searches your private messages for key words to sell to advertisers. If you care about your privacy read about it. If Facebook or subsidiaries care about our privacy they should allow us to opt out and control our data... But if it ours??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook policy. Oumouri,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fraud. Facebook is a fraud and censors the truth. The American people are getting tired of being censored. This is nothing but a corrupt platform using big tech to push their hidden agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facebook is trash. Terrible policies, steals your data, boring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All peoples privacy is comprised under Facebook. I will not let Facebook sell my information to others my privacy is my freedom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Review. Facebook takes incredible care to make sure only select information (from their point of view), is displayed.They will promptly take down anything posted which doesnt suit their agenda.This is supposed to be public people sharing their views and information.In my opinion this information should not be discredited by admins, employed to promote their agenda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taking info. I heard that Tiktok takes information from your phone when you download the app. I really disagree with that idea as soon as I found out I deleted the app. Please change the fact that you can take anyones private information on their phone without their permission.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invasion to privacy. Stores all your data and tracks you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User info. I LOVE this app and wish I didn&#39;t have to delete it. (I am not allowed bc my dad doesn&#39;t want this app on my phone)There are rumours that this app has sent user information to the Chinese government two years ago and it is also believed that this is being continued along with all data on the user&#39;s WHOLE DEVICE and violates the privacy policy (my parents mainly believe this) overall this app is. THE. BEST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy on your devices. TikTok has admitted that they hack into your technology if you have this app so dont get this app and save your personal data and personal things on your phone they know what apps you have they know all your messages on tiktok and on iMessage or on any messaging app they know all your calls so please dont get this app hope you get freaked out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok sells your information. it sells your information if your about to download dont download it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"EVERYONE PLEASE READ. Just for the people out there, always check the privacy policies on the app store. When you scroll down youll be able to see a thing that says data used to track you. From there you can see that they have access to your financial information, physical address and name plus heaps of other stuff. Im not a tech genius but isnt that a little sus? Especially because this is a Chinese company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing information & tracking. Look up lawsuits on google going on right now with their update people. They are secretly using all of your information including facial recognition, your financial information, browsing history, contact info, etc to track you. This is a national security issue as this app is owed by China. If you live in the US I highly recommend deleting and hopefully someone makes a better app to replace TikTok soon bc I enjoy scrolling for hours on these apps like anyone else and it was hard for me to have to delete it for the better of myself & family. Smh the world we live in, just let me enjoy dumb videos in piece",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry but. For those who dont know tiktok steals your personal information. For example when you save a video before you do Tiktok scans your face and keeps your identity in a data base. They also have access to your email, ip, address, contacts etc when downloaded. Basically a spy app. This app was made by a Chinese government basically spying on you without you knowing. Even when youre not on the app it still runs in the background. I recommend you delete it. And delete your account. &lt;3 Edit: I deleted the app before I even deleted my account I was low-key scared, i dont know if this is true but tons of rumours are going around about it And I just want to be safe and you to be too. Theres a lot going on currently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information stealing. I had a lot of fun using this app until I learned that my information would be stolen. Good riddance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app needs to go. Should be banned for privacy concerns. We need to know where our information goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data Privacy Concern. There is a big concern about how the data collected through this app can share with others, please read the privacy policy and make the correct decision for yourself. For me its a definite no for me and my family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data protection. Steals your info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok. Hi Tiktok I just everyone here to know that when you make an account you access your data and media and other things that are private.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data privacy issue. I dont like their data privacy policies and they have to share their with their govt i would not recommend this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this app loves keeping my personal data. tiktok-200MB base app- 2GB of my personal data stored and it doesnt even let me delete it. fun to watch but by god is it a privacy concern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You basically gave them all your personal information. If any of you have read the privacy policy, its scary what they take. Nothing that you have on your phone is safe. Even the search history and websites youve viewed on a different app. You are not safe on this app. Delete It Now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Please stop stealing data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy . I love this app its amazing but I heard this app track everything about you and I dont like that ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Make sure u dont lose your SIM card to your number or you cant take down your account I have had so much trouble with trying to delete my account from tiktok and send then info they asked for and them asking for the same info 5 other times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth it. i dont care who has my data from me using this app bring me the content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They steal your data. Found out they steal so much of your personal data from your phone, you dont even need to use it. So much data that it shouldnt need to have access to and if you block the server that it sends that data to, YOU CANT USE TIKTOK. Seriously delete this app, some Chinese company is trying to hoard data for advertisers, or worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash. This app collects your data with consent on whatever platform you use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop stealing information. This app takes your information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They watch you. These creators of tiktok use your data and memories from your device and use them without consent and theyre very badly using your personal information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data freedom. Until today, Sep 3th 2021, people share whatever they believe is right and there is minimum censorship on their data sharing in this app, its great Also it finds your interests by analyzing much more efficient and faster than other social media apps Love it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop taking info. In the terms and conditions it literally says we take info on where you live your IP address and others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stealing information. Its a great app and I love it but I read this article on how tiktok is just a company stealing your personal info ( phone number , emails and even your drafts  ) soo didnt want to take any chances so I deleted it ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals user info. This app steals your information and lots of the content isnt worth checking out as there is no quality control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I really enjoy this app its quite entertaining. With that being said I do not appreciate the invasive tracking and data collection. Yada yada yada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy problems. Not sure I really want TikTok stealing all my data... thats why you guys need Reddit.Redditors... assemble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Info stealing. The app is entertaining but the way its using our location is pathetic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good way to get your data stolen. Im really suprised people still use this app when they already know their data is being sold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals information about you. I TikTok is a great app if youre.  just  board. But what you probably didnt know is that TikTok steals your information about you even when you not on the app is you are instead and want to know more you can search it up and there is a Federal investigation so if you care about your information I wouldnt  download it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy concerns. There is literally no personal privacy, it tracks everything you do down to what you copy on your clipboard. Look, parents, if youre reading this and these issues made you concerned - think about it this way. Everything we consume now is selling information to make their profit, the real concern is if the way theyre storing this data is safe. Do you let your kids use Instagram? Snapchat? Facebook? Hell, the internet in general? Then dont worry, cant get worse. If they want it, let them. The app overall is a tonne of fun. Although, I honestly cant continue using an app that is collecting this much information and is based in China. In this political climate, I dont want my information being used as a weapon of war. Lets be honest, though. If they want it, theyll get it either way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new privacy thing ruined my account. I get there are weird people on here that we have to be careful of, but the way that Tiktok takes it upon itself to be overprotective has really annoyed me. Your parents are meant to do that, not the app itself. I find it unfair that because of a few things that have happened we all have to have unnecessary protection. People cant comment on my posts now, I dont understand the danger of comments or stitching or duets.Overall I like the people on the app but I hate the actual company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you realise?. Do you realise what info this app is getting from each user, I wont be downloading this app so you can glean all my info. This is what your allowing the creators of this app to take from you:- Purchases, Financial Info, Location, Contact Info, Contacts, User Content, Search History, Browsing History, Identifiers, Usage Data and Diagnostics. If your happy letting these people know all your doing you contacts and sharing your finances with them This Is The App For You Share Away",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok privacy age policy. I hate the new privacy age policy its so horrible like what the gel TikTok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DELETE IT NOW. TIKTOK TRACKS DOWN YOUR LOCATION GETS YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND TELLS PEOPLE THAT INFORMATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data privacy..???. At first I really liked this app as it full of entertainment source and I always see stuff which I like the most......... wait what..? How is it possible...? Data stealing...? Let me explain, whenever I search something on Google and then after few hours or days that product or related to that search pops up in TIKTOK whenever I open the app the ads shows up...???? I mean what is it..? Any explanations...??? Data privacy is biggest issue nowadays",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For privacy. Privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spying on us. Although I love this app, but it violates your privacy and it stores your information and everything you copy. Delete it right now ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible app. Its stores data and tracks you, whenever the privacy policy updates they make it less likely for you to check it, its used for way to much hate speech and spreading of misinformation, its ruining peoples mental health. If its downloaded delete it. And if its not downloaded dont get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who is getting their hands on my data?. Is TikTok obliged to supplying my data to a foreign government without my consent?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invaision to privacy. Tracks what you do from other things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal information. You are sharing personal images, which can be helpful things for bad peoples. Dont get this app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leaking privacy. Not good app to use at all. It leak your privacy just check its term and conditions before accepting them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO NOT GET THE APP. They are collecting your data (email address name location) and selling it to companies if this information is breached then anyone could get your information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Information stealer?. So many articles have been written about TikTok taking your information. Its affecting us. Plz stop, there are 10 year olds on this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its a great app but sketchy. WARNING READ THE POLICY BEFORE DOWNLOADINGWhen you read the policy its very sketchy  within  the first paragraph it talks about giving your information to third parties and that it uses info from messages from your phone book also users have shared that messages have been sent from their device that they didnt send in a different language. It also collects your IP address. Theres tons of sketchy behaviour but that was just a few. Do you still wanna give your name, email, age , phone number, country etc to this app?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok bad review. They use your information and share it around the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't even bother with this app, you'll encounter many issues regarding tiktok's help centre & community guidelines. for example, i personally have spent the last 2 years growing my audience of roughly 62k as of now, and am seriously considering calling it quits. i use my platform to spread awareness, and create a safe space for mental illnesses & disorders, as i suffer from many myself. i have many videos regarding the behaviours, side effects, symptoms, etc of my own personal experiences, in hopes that it will find the people who need to relate, or even learn something about it. BUT - here's where it gets a whole lot messy. by having a larger following, and many videos shown on the for you page"" - content gets spam reported ALL. THE. TIME. and tiktok", luckily for us all, doesn't even review the content that's reported unless you APPEAL IT. then, they don't check the appeals for days, or even weeks at a time. sure, not a big deal if it happens once or twice, but again, it's not that simple. wether your appeal is granted or not, your violation is noted under your account, thus making it more likely to have your account banned for hours, days or even weeks to months (for no actual reason!). they'll grant your appeal, and keep you banned for however long, making it that much more infuriating. sure, you can write reports, or even try to contact tiktoks help centre, but that'll just waste even more of your time, as they don't know how to check that, either. this is an ongoing issue for myself, and a large majority of the content creating community on tiktok. all of that to say, if you plan on making something of yourself on social media, pick a different source. you're better off."
Well :/. So basically TikTok is an invasion of privacy and it stands you for no reason and its just a bit of a waste of your storage like you can download it if you want but like youre just ban you and then like yeah and then theyll be a day access your phone number because its private privacy details and they also need to know your birthday and your email address and everything and thats all private information so you can download it but its a waste of storage and yeah so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy Invasion. Terrible app for everyone. It steals and monitors a lot of your data including your clipboard and apps installed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DONT GET TIKTOK. DONT GET TIKTOK. It takes your personal info and tracks your location. If you already have it, delete it AND your account The app tiktok, it gets your location, and goes through your phone when you leave the app. It gets your email address and many more creepy things. It stores your information in a database AND knows EXACTLY who you are. ITS HORRIBLE. It will track your location, it gets your contacts and goes through EVERYTHING. IF YOU HAVE IT ALREDY, DELETE IT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"App knows what you do on your Phone. I use to be a big fan of TikTok, but on 2 occasions I have become aware of things immediately popping up in my feed relating directly to what I was just texting and search for on the internet.This is totally unethical and will be deleting this app today. I would advise all users to research the well documented security risks that are associated with this app before using.Very very disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guidelines. There are a lot of things about this app that I enjoy but after a few of my videos got taken down and a few of my friends got their accounts taken down Ive started to feel a little uncomfortable when making content as I feel that TikTok is unfair in how it deals with sensitive content. I feel the guidelines of TikTok need to be reviewed and changed to be more like that of instagram or Twitter. TikTok is too strict and it is putting a lot of people off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Never ever get this app. Never ever ever gets this app recently its been tracking peopleAccess your personal information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. TikTok has such a great and addictive algorithm because it tracks you outside the app extensively. Also has no regulations in terms of privacy in the US. Other countries the app is available in, has to allow users to have privacy options for TikTok. We don't have that option here in the states. Won't be using.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy accounts. Privacys account under 15 it so dumb haft of the TikTok community is under 15. And I know it for a special reason but still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool. i love this app so much. i just hate how it steals your information you put on it. it is not safe for personal information... other then that its really fun to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shares your data . This app has been known to share your personal data to Beijing under Chinese law. Many people in its leadership are in the Chinese Communist Party. It even admits to collecting data such as your own search history, other apps youve used, your photos and your own location. Delete this app if you have it and rate it one star and spread the message on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
info about tiktok TAKING info?. a ton of people have been saying tiktok STEALS your info and shares it with other companies. If you wanna use tiktok and do not wanna allow tiktok to take your info its very easy to turn off tracking and if youre not sure how heres a tutorial: [iphone only]first go to settings scroll down to tiktok press tiktok and disable  allow tracking . Now youre able to play on tiktok without having your info shared youre welcome &lt;3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not download takes your data and personal stuff. They take your personal data like your name your friends your messages everything even the us government has proven that this is true Be careful guys it gives it to the Chinese government this is not a theory this is a fact  BEWARE usa  government has proven this a fact  sadly it is very addictive the app is horrible. You can download it if you want all your personal data sold to others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steals data. This app steals your personal information, name, address, etc. Though, what makes this bad is that the information is then transferred over to......China. Believe it or not. Theres heavy amounts of information to support this. At this point, it is speculated that the information is also sold on the deep web. Again, including your name, location, passwords to accounts on any media app or possibly banking information. I urge you to do research for yourself on either google or YouTube. Both of those platforms will have roughly the same data as I do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am concerned. This app is great but I have heard that the creators are stealing private data from users and taking it too the government and they will track your location find your number and email so my question is... WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktoks data. I\'ve been looking around lately at apps and I looked at tiktoks APP PRIVACY tab. explain why you need our precise location?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app sees all of your data. I have just found out the danger of TikTok it collects info and sells it to companies do not download it and delete if u have it straight away They can see what u message and the can hear everything TikTok is horrible do not download it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My Account Was Hacked. This application steals your identity information. All of my social media and emails were hacked. Im still trying to recover from this hideous situation. Do not download this app unless your able to pay for the price of exposing your own personal life to the world. Its a frequency thing, be wise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would be nice if this app respected my privacy more. And also paid its content creators. Anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spying. TikTok is great and all, I love watching videos and making them too, but I discovered a video on YouTube about how TikTok is spying on you. Apparently it spies on all your latest searches, all the passwords you put in, and it collects personal data. I found that this was a bad thing and I did not want TikTok to keep spying on me. So I came down to a conclusion which was to delete my account and the app. For all you TikTok lovers I recommend going to a search platform and searching Does TikTok spy on you? Or something similar. Theres a video of someone telling you what it does and other things. I would have kept TikTok if only it wasnt unsafe. It is up to you to decide whether you want to keep TikTok or not. You decide",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It sells your personal information. So as somebody that uses TikTok its an amazing app but I wouldnt recommend it only because of this one thing (I heard about this)It apparently sells your information to China. I mean minus that the videos are amazing and the community is funny and nice If TikTok stops selling our information to China then Id be fully satisfied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Share all you information to 3rd party. Before you guys download this app please read T&amp;call other document I just read all policy its clearly says they can used all our information to other companies.i dont want that so I boycott this Chinese app. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love it so much. I love TiktokPlease dont ban tiktok.If you ban tiktok I will be sssssooooo sad.But if the government does not ban tiktok still do not share your personal information.But tiktok is totally safe and is even better than most social media apps.#savetiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No respect for privacy. So it recently popes me a contact to add on tik tok which I had deleted long time back on my phone. Deleted would recommend others too. No privacy in this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop storing info about us. Why are you storing data from our phones and putting it some where its not for you to know what we are keeping in our phones, its our private lives so stop. I cant post tiktok a now because my mum is scared your gonna store more info about me .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"needs help lolol. so this app is super fun &amp; entertaining to use. if you&#39;re simply looking to scroll through - it&#39;s wonderful. if you&#39;re looking to become a creator, save your time. once you gain a decent following, you&#39;ll encounter many issues regarding tiktok&#39;s help centre &amp; community guidelines. for example, i personally have spent the last 2 years growing my audience of roughly 37000 as of now, and am seriously considering calling it quits. i use my platform to spread awareness, and create a safe space for mental illnesses &amp; disorders, as i suffer from many myself. i have many videos regarding the behaviours, side effects, symptoms, etc of my own personal experiences, in hopes that it will find the people who need to relate, or even learn something about it. BUT - here&#39;s where it gets a whole lot messy. by having a larger following, and many videos shown on the &#34;for you page&#34; - content gets spam reported ALL. THE. TIME. and tiktok, luckily for us all, doesn&#39;t even review the content that&#39;s reported unless you APPEAL IT. then, they don&#39;t check the appeals for days, or even weeks at a time. sure, not a big deal if it happens once or twice, but again, it&#39;s not that simple. wether your appeal is granted or not, your violation is noted under your account, thus making it more likely to have your account banned for hours, days or even weeks to months (for no actual reason). they&#39;ll grant your appeal, and keep you banned for however long, making it that much more infuriating. sure, you can write reports, or even try to contact tiktoks help centre, but that&#39;ll just waste even more of your time, as they don&#39;t know how to check that, either. this is an ongoing issue for myself, and a large majority of the content creating community on tiktok. all of that to say, if you plan on making something of yourself on social media, pick a different source. you&#39;re better off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data leak. This app is using personal data and selling for bad purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chinese Government Spy App. Listen, I know the title is kinda odd, but trust me. If you look, a LOT is collected by TikTok. They dont even have a privacy policy They steal your info and its also PUBLIC This app blew up, and Im telling you,dont install this personal info-stealing app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News/dont download this app. Do NOT download this app,over a month ago,on the news , it said tiktok has been secretly saving all ur data,looking at ur drafts,saving ur ip,email,and adress,so they have scanned ur face if u have posted it,and they know excactly who you are,please be safe and do NOT download this app,i thought it was fun and i loved it until i found out it knew my location and excactly who I was. :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok is TERIBLE. It tracks personal information ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app stole data from my contacts. After downloading the app, I set my Privacy Settings to NOT allow access to my contacts. Later, scrolling through the  For You page on the app, I saw a video clearly labeled, From Your Contacts. I double checked my settings to see if I had made a mistake on setting my permissions, however, the setting was set to deny permission, but Tiktok had overridden it -w/o changing it.  Apparently, the mistake I made was in downloading the app. Apple, PLEASE FIX THIS, as these criminals of data, wont.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DELETE IT RIGHT NOW. i was reading an article about tik tok and they are stealing and selling your info while useing the app You wont belive me but its true They are secretly doing it in the background data. The best way to stop that is DELETE and DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT I did already and i feal so much safer than when i read that. Be safe and delete it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh. yall dont realize how much personal info this app takes from u ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dosent care about your privacy. App sucks not trustworthy and logs things when its closed delete it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OWNED BY THE CPP . If you download this app and use it, the Chinese government has access to your information. The creators of TikTok have no choice but to hand it over whenever the government asks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do not use this app. This app collects data on you including search history, keystrokes, images, and apps used on your phone. Stay away to protect your privacy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing. You better leave TikTok it takes personal info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals your data. This app steals your data and gives it to people. They have also have really bad security and have allowed hackers to look at your private videos and many similar incidents to stuff like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Needs better monitoring. Ive seen a lot of stuff that is illegal on this app and when it is reported nothing happens to the accounts. Ive seen people talk about being pedophiles and zoophiles on here and when reporting them I get a notification saying nothing wrong was found. This is disgusting that people are allowed have accounts where they post stuff like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love the app but this . So there was this tiktoker that made a video saying how all the stuff you have on your phone (history, etc.) is said to be sent to the people who created tiktok or something, I do not want my privacy to be invaded and sent to somewhere in china, overall I love this app ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A shady app. This app is juts bad. If you dont agree with me thats fine. But be warned that in the private policy and the terms of service have some extremely shady things in it. For example, in the private policy is says that they can read what you text to someone in whatever app you use to message someone (you can look that up yourself). So take this as a warning before you download it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok privacy. I love TikTok because its fun and it is safe I love making videos and getting likes and followers its a great thing to do The new update is great I love TikTok so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Okay. the app has like 10 percent of actual good content, app steals a lot of data and is not respecting users privacy. i think the government should force tiktok to change their code to not steal so much data like they are right now. otherwise delete this app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government Surveillance. I dont like how Tiktok creators are giving everyone intel through this app. It is a breach in our privacy. I really hope everyone deletes this app if type terms are still to give the Chinese government are private information. Really disappointing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. I really like TikTok but I dont like how the Chinese government can track us even if we have a private account and they try to get your personal information and stuff so even if you give your fake birthday or whatever they still can track you and stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey Im worried. Hi I used to have a TikTok account yet delted it last year due to the fact that it may have been deleted in australia and that we had been tracked and that stuff, just wondering before I re-download if I will be tracked/hacked and that, because Im not comfortable with TikTok being able to tap into my photos as there are pictures of me and my family and personal things. The fact you can see my contacts is weird? And that you can see my app purchases and finance, please disregard those. If you could answer me TikTok, that would be greatI loved my account however I only got on the fyp 3 times with over 100-200 videos before I went private, my friend got shadow banned, and all my other friends dont want to go un-private in case we are being tracked and TikTok isnt secure Ty for reading, and if you could inform me please about this TikTok that would be great.Verification- I think that people should be verified at 1 million followers because they have 1 million people following them, not to mention all the people who dont have accountsMultiple accounts and email- I wish I could make multiple accounts, but Id have to make a whole new email, Im not willing to do that. If you delete your account are you able to make a new one with that email? And if you forget your password, will TikTok send you an email about resetting your password?IK this is long sorry, do I need the email to be linked to this specific device? Bc I have another email Im using for this account that I will be making.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awful. I have had enough of this app, it is controlling, addictive and does not comply with what you choose as per privacy, I have removed my email from my account yet I still get updates. Chose content is inappropriate and people are generally stupid if they post on this  foul excuse of a social platform. DISGUSTING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy and censorship. I dont like Tik Toks privacy policy or the fact that the app can accumulate so much information/data about users. Also, its a known fact that the app censors the content of users from visible and sexual minorities. The concept of the app is interesting but I disagree with the way the app is managed and most importantly I value my privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you value privacy - then dont use this. It steals your information and sends it to China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DO NOT get TikTok. I have the latest update for IOS and everytime TikTok extracts something from my clipboard it warns me with a notification, if you dont know know what that means it means that they are stealing info and possibly selling it to random people dont get TikTok it will steal your information like Ive already seen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy concerns. Was using it for sometime, but few days back read about its privacy terms and conditions. Was surprised to see the details. Would recommend to please go through it carefully, and then install it. For just a video sharing platform such level of permissions are not needed. I have uninstalled it and still worried if the data at their end will be deleted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont download. This app is designed to steal your information through spyware. I dont know how long itll be before they take down this review so please spread awareness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guidelines. I do like this app very much its just the guidelines are very and extremely strict I have had my TikToks taken down with no reason and been banned with no reason I feel like If you report something there is a very high chance it will get taken down that is if its making TikTok money but thats really my only problem with this app and highly recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TikToks creators are stupid and I wish trump succeeded in removing this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. For messaging in TikTok youre required to add your phone number. Why is that for? Is it the purpose of the app to create a data bank?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrible. I have recently found out that the owners of TikTok steal and use people personal data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stolen. Well, I heard Tiktok steals your private information. Is that true? I had to uninstall the app because of it. I hope its not true, I dont want it to be. I gave you 2 stars instead of 1 because I am unsure if it is right or not. Thank you for reading",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our information being leaked. I heard that tiktok has been stealing our information. If this is true Im suing you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tik Tok steals your info. Do not download unless you want TikTok to sell your info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharing personal data with third party. Not happy after reading terms and conditions#corona &amp; #tiktok #came #from #same #place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not use this. Look up what the privacy agreement does it steals everything from your phone and everything you look at even if youre not using it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review. Not impressimpressed with the new policy on bullying  that my account is on privacy so you let me get doxxed and thats not legal  do better tiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop stealing our data. how about you dont track literally everything i do inside and outside the app?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No way I like this. This app is stealing my personal information and all of America deleted tiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the report function within the app is useless. before i even get into this, i have been using this app for just about 5 years now. and it is simply the most disgusting experience on the internet.ive seen countless creators on tiktok be taken down for zero reason, having to make new accounts and start over. ive seen popular videos/audios with nothing violating guidelines be removed for zero reason. how many videos of mine, of my friends, have been removed for minor safety but we are not minors? the guidelines are straight forward but are not maintained by themselves. i have had my account threatened to be terminated because minor safety - delinquent behaviour. i have seen people encouraging acts of criminal behaviour such as stealing, robbery, SA, assault, of which are still up with millions of likes. but someone holding a vaping device gets taken down? make it make sense.ive seen videos containing literal pornography, with thousands of likes, of which tiktok will not take down even when reported. they do not oversee these videos. i have seen people linking videos to graphic, gore-y videos while the next video on my For You Page is a literal 6 year old playing with fake kitchen utensils; not to mention the 40 year old in the comments saying how hed love for the CHILD to cook for him in his home. not to even mentioning the silence of LGBT, POC and every minorities voice. fresh accounts are not shown videos with these kinds of hashtags in the slightest. with everyone fighting to get popular on this app, only straight white men actually make it big.there is zero actual monitoring of what gets posted, reported, or talked about on this app. theyre trying to take over other popular social media apps by adding stories, of which i have not seen a single person use or say they enjoyed having this feature. i have only seen complaints about limited features / accessshould go without saying but this app breeds toxicity and bullying; bringing the worst of every side of the internet into one giant cesspool that you are forced to interact with. there is no avoiding the bad sides of this app without using it. misinformation and stolen content is what thrives on this app. there isnt even a section of the report feature to report stolen content. what???the security features protecting accounts have many giant holes within it, more than one friend of mine has accidentally logged into random peoples ENTIRE ACCOUNTS. on complete and utter accident. so then what happens when someone actually tries to hack into someones account? dont count on recovery options either because often tiktok service servers are down more often than theyre up. thats to say if they even respond; taking 3 months to reply to any sort of email of contact support. complete radio silence for people trying to reach out to them.this is a multi million dollar company not caring about their users in the slightest, features and content within the app are buggy and often simply dont work, tiktok needs to sort their issues out. im disgusted everyday about the content on this app and no one actually talks about it; or if they do its been silenced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals your info. Dont download steals your info worse than Facebook,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Have you read the privacy statement. Why  We collect and process, which includes scanning and analyzing, information you provide in the context of composing, sending, or receiving messages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please dont download. Hey internet peoples, before I say anything else u am NOT a Karen mum. Im a 15 y/o child. I just wanted to say that TikTok does STEAL FILES and has admin permissions on your phone. Of course do your own research but before you download, keep in mind that if you are slightly concerned that apple knows more about you than anyone else and can accurately predict some crazy things like the likelihood of you being a future te-ror-ist. I would be extremely concerned about a Chinese company knowing the exact same information about you, which gets transmitted by unsecured wire connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stupid. Tired of seeing things that arent in my language. And if you make me update the app again just to use it Ill delete and never use tiktok again. Dont know why all these social media apps make you update when nothing changes. Makes one think theyre slowly trying to sell your information the more they can find out about you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is horrible. This app steals data without consent and is plain awful. I stand for Reddit, tiktok trash",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scammers. Do not allow TikTok tracking your phone - do not put your phone number in details just email only  thats how protecting your privacy. They blocked my posting many times with random reasons cos you from America , Canada, Australia who is telling about true human rights in China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has so many things that track you. just scroll down on tiktoks app store page and youll see everything that they collect and probably give to other companies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Idk what has happened but it has. People have been reporting in YouTube saying you take our data that is not cool I love this app but that just made me delete it nobody should steel peoples private info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All your information is being stolen. This app literally keeps records of every single thing you click on your phone simply by having in installed. On tiktok or not, Id youve ever typed passwords or personal information while this app is installed then China has it. This is app is disguised as something good but its just a massive Chinese scheme to destroy their enemy countries from within",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Its a fun and great app but it would be better if u added more privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ummmmmm. Apparently this app is controlled by the Chinese government. Stealing your information? Listening to private information ? Faking phenomenons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Serious privacy issues. Absolutely one of the worst apps on the App Store. Should be removed as soon as possible. TikTok can circumvent Apples privacy protections and uses device tracking that gives TikToks Beijing based parent company ByteDance full access to users data. Delete IMMEDIATELY.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Official TikTok review. This is a strange Chinese app that collects data and can disrupt your privacy. I dont recommend downloading it unless you want your data being sold to the Chinese government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great for business something. Hello Tiktok is a great platform but it feels in supporting young creators and small business owners. I used it all the time but when people are unhappy they can easily report you and have you been with no evidence. I believe TickTocks and look into protecting their creators in homebase businesses from malicious customers and people. You should not be able to get banned off of one person reporting your account. Please I hope you hear me and look into this as soon as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey Im worried.

Information. I am enjoying the amount of information and knowledge of what I am finding on TikTok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPYWARE - DELETE APP NOW. The Chinese government steals your data + personal info and uses it against you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok stealing your personal info. Tiktok steals your info and sells it to china, dont get this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cyber security threat and terrible for your mental health. As someone who has used tiktok for about 1 year now I have only just started to realise all of the negative effects it has had on my health. An example of this is being on it for hours before i go to bed until about midnight which has caused me to wake up later. When you look at scientific studies it shows that tiktok shortens attention spans due to both how the algorithm works and how shortform content like tiktok is.Tiktok is also a gigantic cyber security threat to every single country, the chinese government have access to all of tiktoks incredibly invasive data, if you look at the privacy policy you see things like them being able to use your search history, videos of yourself(including drafts) and terms of comments. A lot of people that I know when they hear about these privacy breaches dont understand why it is so bad so to people like that, if a company has BILLIONS of peoples, private info, comstant location, isp etc. That company then sells that data and then a random person in the world knows almost everything about you, and in the case of tiktok this information is used by the government as a weapon against government officials and anyone with power.If you dont think thats bad enough a lot of the money taken from tiktoks revenue is by the chinese government and they have killed millions in modern day concentration camps so you arent supporting anyone good, i know that google and facebook arent good either but at least they arent war criminals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy concerns. Not confident about the privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Creepy. I TikTok is a great app but its very very creepy. They take all your information and store it in Chinese government I deleted immediately after I found out this because I used to have a count it is not OK for this. It is invading our privacy and it needs to be addressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DONT GET IT. Recently people have been getting messages from TikTok saying they know where the person lives. It can access your personal information, it knows what apps you have been on, it tracks your messages you send on there and it can see your search history. There is a lot more. If you want more information then search up Delete TikTok on YouTube and select the video with the title Uninstall TikTok now by Liyan Channel. Please do NOT get this app if you want you and your family to be safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Save Social Platform. I Use TikTok over other social media networks because it provides safety for users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love TikTok. Everyone talks about USA taking it down TikTok has no personal info on me I feel completely safe having TikTok downloaded to my phone If something should be taken down it should be Facebook Several times Facebook has had problems with our info being leaked out I hope you stay forever TikTok ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be careful. TikTok is facing a global backlash over security concerns. Your data and personal details may be sent to the Chinese Communist Party.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To TikTok. Thank you for creating this app it is the best app in the world.But I am a little bit sad that my account is private.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Community Guidelines and Violations. This is increasingly becoming an issue for content creators on TikTok where I see them moving to new platforms as their accounts get reported and banned with no rhyme or reason. Even videos that duet other videos get taken down with no apparent violations of the rules. The app will need to change if it is to continue to grow and limiting content creators will unfortunately only make things move backwards and cause them to lose money as people move their content elsewhere. It was a good app to create with at first but all the restrictions and lack of response from any customer service is troubling. I personally have had trolls report my account during live video streams and then TikTok has removed my access, and therefore access to income, indiscriminately and it seems to be without human review. As TikTok becomes less accessible for creators and consumers alike the app will sadly fail and their algorithm will be sold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrible company behind this app. TikTok has an allure, but once you start to realize just how much they censor and suppress content from what they consider undesirables  LGBT, older people, people with disabilities, unattractive, overweight, etc  your account will be suspended over the tiniest infraction of their long list of things you cant do, or your videos will be suppressed and never shown. China also gets ALL this data to spy on you, too. This app should really be removed from the App Store.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a great app but Im worried about my privacy. Over all its a great app but Im concerned about my privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you expect. Its TikTok you know what you are coming for. Just wish they would have better policies for deleting content. They seem to go after LGBTQIA+ folks and ban content from them more than others. Also I was banned from a post for calling someone out that was bullying. So there are flaws with the app and people who run it but over all its a fun app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fast and Furious Thats tiktok. Tiktok is the most fast paced social media platform to date. You will get hypnotized by all the content that the algorithm believes you may like.Hours of scrolling down at all the potentially entertaining videos. And you may also find people following you and receive quick small time fame.The trouble is that tiktok is the app that will keep giving you content. Its a never ending machine of media thats being pushed on to you whether you know it or not.I found myself getting addicted to interacting with the app. From posting content and gain likes and follows to commenting my thoughts and feelings. And there was this high Id get. I felt this validation and short term satisfaction.I also felt burnout and depressed when my hopes and expectations were not met multiple times. I felt real sick of it all. Id constantly delete the app so I wouldnt have access. But Id just download the app again and the vicious cycle would repeat itself.  Fortunately I eventually got blacklisted. I lost a lot viewership as a result. That really got me down in the dumps. I couldnt get that usual high I was so used to at that point.In the end I got banned for good. I got in trouble with what I posted. Copyright music/this japanese gameshow with a pornstar/and a old video game commercial with scifi guns (that got me in the most trouble).In conclusion, tiktok is a super fast sort of information sharing place. You see so much so fast that it really messes with your mind. I find myself in a zombie state. Always consuming information. There is a lot of garbage videos youll end up seeing whether you like it or not. And losing your patience in general.Oh and theres some other cons. Like nowadays I get random phone calls from other states. I just assume the worst. That tiktok took my private information like my phone number and sold it to third party companies. Dont have proof, but meh. All in all, tiktok is a extremely overwhelming and fast paced place. And its not for me, I am just another sucker wholl stick to watching dog and cat videos on youtube. Congrats of you read all this. Your reward is free knowledge. How much is it worth? Thats all relative to you I suppose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This trash invaded your privacy. This app is just another piece of trash that China came up with to spy on the world. Notwithstanding all the mental health issues that unethical, greedy, corrupt social media platforms like TikTok create in our society through online interactions that are fickle, narcissistic, shallow and gives women and men a place to needlessly sexualise and cheapen themselves to the rest of the world. To merely have this app on your phone is a sure fire way to know you have very serious mental health problems. Not forgetting what I said earlier about China creating TikTok under the badly disguised image of an independent Chinese company to gather every single users private information and spy on them, although at this rate most people are aware of the fact that the Chinese government owns and controls TikTok. Download this social media cancerous parasite of an app at your own risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Personal Information being taken?. Ive heard that the company is stealing personal information this so happens to be confirmed by anonymous that they are Chinese spys upon the app, if so this app should be banned and deleted as it is in India.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Online Privacy Issue. Best social media platform out there Users can be creative, supportive and find a fun and loving community No other social media platform makes you feel safe and respected to JUST BE YOURSELF as TikTok does TikTok IS FABULOUS however I just learned that UrleBird.com is a mirror image of TikTok that sells things off the content of TikTok. I did not give consent for my content to be used on this site and I would like TikTok to dismantle UrleBird.com as soon as possible. Its not right that this site is using our content to sell product that we do not agree with or consent to. Please consider taking UrleBird.com down and destroying the content on it. Thank-you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enjoying TikTok. Its nice to still be able to have a voice and not be censored as much as we are on Facebook and Twitter . TikTok is proving to be a pretty reliable source. Ive made great friends on here and we enjoy each others opinions. This app is addicting LOL before you know it the TikTok man comes up saying its time to take a break One more thing Ive found on here.I get the news on here first days before the news media outlets Its nice to hear it and to be able to tell for sure when the news media outlets are lying to you and pushing their fake news and the leftist agendas. Refreshing for a app to still have the users best interest in heart and not big tech censorship for the government. Well I have to admen this reviewthe trolls that report you on here is real. If you dare say the truth that they dont agree with and BAM .you are silenced and threatened by TikTok that they will remove your platform. Never dreamed the United States would shut up and censor the truth of their citizens like Cuba and every other communist country. TikTok forgets that without us they would be nothing but instead of appreciating us they will silence us from spreading the truth but will allow woman to sell theirselves and protect pedophiles. We have reported this over and over again and this app protects them. Thats a hard truth we face on the app everyday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leak data information. It is unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont download tiktok. they spy on you they know your Private information and more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can track you?. I was looking for updates and it said Data used to track you. This freaked me out and dose it really do that? If so Im deleting the app and my device.Over all good app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't trust. Don&#39;t trust this app they can read all of your information and keep it they have everything about you, don&#39;t trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage guidelines. I&#39;ve been blocked from changing ANY information on my profile for &#34;violating too many guidelines&#34; when I&#39;ve never even posted a TikTok or done anything wrong. You can&#39;t even appeal the block or ban and they don&#39;t even tell you why there&#39;s a ban,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok is a pro-CCP company that censors any pro-Hong Kong content. This app has censored many pro-Hong Kong / Tianimen square content. Not to mention, the app itself is owned by a Chinese company, which has close links to the inner communist party of China. The TOS states that this app will collect as much data from you as physically possible, and most likely sells it back to the CCP. Anything from keystrokes to pictures that youd never want to leak, it is absolutely not okay. In fact, US government officials and military personnel are not allowed to use TikTok at all, because of this data collecting. Please do not use this app, there is a reason why the US government considers it a security threat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. Search for some info about your Tik tok privacy in google, they actually spy you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issues. Can you please confirm if TikTok sends data back to China and what that data discloses? I heard from a United States Congressman that there are heaps of data points shared with China more than most other apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Better data privacy and Id be fine. I think this app is fine. Im not mad at it for its functions, I am mad at it for transferring data back to China reducing the security for average folk. I really wanted to love this, but the insecure data prevents me from recommending it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Breaches Security. Uninstall right now. This app tracks my location from my sim card instead of location services. It didn&#39;t ask for my permission to do so and is not mentioned anywhere on its documentation. It is very fishy why a video sharing app should need it. It might also be collecting data about my calls as well. You cannot ask for information as it is a chinese app (no racism just fact) regulated by their government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont use. App collects data from your SIM card. Doesnt mention this in the privacy policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Big Danger. This App Allows Other People To Access Personal Infomation, Even With The Settings. I Advise You NOT To Download This App, Watch Tik Toks On YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Awful use of data. This company is selling your data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DELETE THIS APP NOW. Ive heard that this app has been recording peoples personal information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good app kinda. I like this app but I deleted it because I heard the government watches you and goes through all your stuff and collects all your information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do not download. It steals your data. If you do get this app after seeing this, read the terms and conditions. There is stuff they are not telling you. Please do not get this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If my information comes at the cost of a brilliant community, Ill take it. I spend so much time on this app because it has diverse and accessible platforms of people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sharing ur personal information. Tiktok is a chinese app as we all know. What you might not know that the Chinese government has full access to your information in the app. By 2030, china is trying to become superpower in Artificial Intelligence and by getting our personal and sensitive info, location, likes/dislikes, preferences, china is getting all the information to influence us without our consent. Moreover, if u have any doubts, just search for which is the  parent company of tiktok, and u will understand everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok. Hi devaIve been using TikTok but I had to stop because of privacy reasons. Can you please not sell peoples data? Then I&#39;ll rejoin. From @ytmeowy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its horrible. Whenever you use it someone gets all your information delete this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data cautious beware. This app tracks and uses far more personal data than needed. I am not using it for this reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Highly unrecommended. This app is disgusting its negative and toxic and so not worth it its no longer fun musically and its allows the videos of 18+ to stay up doing really inappropriate things. It allows horrifying content to stay up such as a young child being ***** by and adult and its high detention for the worst social media people get bullied and they dont take down content like that but they take down content speaking up about body shaming being bad and racism being bad and keep content of people over 40 harassing teenage girls and I am just horrified Im not going to be specific but I will say that this is worst than instagram and they need to remove toxic accounts which they dont. They also dont evenly promote the accounts and they entertain content like underage **x and more worse just to say this app isnt for everyone but I feel its for no one, no one should go through what I went through I was bullied and kept reporting the account the messages and the account was still up and they were leaking information that is illegal and TikTok didnt take it down people were pretending to be me and they did so much and TikTok still didnt do anything about it I know its hard during covid-19 but instagram still works and that all the social media I need as I reported the person on instagram and it work with minutes in my opinion dont get it but I feel I speak for everyone on the app its hard to leave even though it has its bad it does have its good but 1 star because its promoting things that are so bad and I hope they consider that just because your a popular creator doesnt mean you get away with things like saying the N word, promoting drinks and more so I think they souls kick some of or suspend accounts before I use it again as I feel scared when I go on the app or post things and I should feel happy even if my accounts private I want to mask videos that make people smile not videos that make people mock me or be racist. So I hope it goes into consideration about what they do to remove racist account or abusive famous or not. Or then it just proves that TikTok has no control over these horrible people. But over all download if you can handle hate racism body shaming and worse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BEWARE. THEY ARE STEALING OUR INFORMATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy thingy. Hey, i rlly like tiktok and all. But im pretty sure there use to be a privacy setting enabling you account to not come up when searched for. I would really appreciate if you could add this back. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hat this app. People are disrespectful, and this app is taking peoples datas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This app sells your data. The owner of this app aka the chinese owner sells your data on the darkweb and passwords etc I recommend deleting this app right away unless you have good a good vpn etc that saves ur data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NO GET THIS APP. No one download this app it was confirmed by tiktok that they give all your information to the Chinese government which is a huge risk for America and Canada thats why there banning it, so tiktok gives ur up address your contact information, including your home address, and it is not safe to use. I deleted the app right away when I heard about all this. And also they collect data from ur device like your device model number, what other apps you use besides tiktok and they collect the data from those apps, such as Snapchat or instagram. Everyone be careful and delete this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data. Needed to get a bigger data plan to support my TikTok addiction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep our identity safe. Many would say dont do tiktok because they may hack your accounts. Please Tiktok keep us all safe from identity thief and please keep it wholesome for all user. Filter those that are showing their nudity or using inappropriate words or misleading information because there are also kids using it. I would still give you 5 star because you help me with my anxiety and depression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spying. Tiktok is spying on us and stealing our private info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok, be responsible. theres literally cp as some peoples profile pictures, racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, antisemitism, and CHILD GROOMERS on this app, yet when I report it, nothing comes of it. yet, when someone speaks about about it on their profile ie. making a video about it, letting other people KNOW and letting them ACKNOWLEDGE that this is happening on this app, you guys delete the videos that they made because it goes against our community guidelines. If it does in fact go against your community guidelines, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Stop silencing creators that are trying to inform people about the issues around this world and on this app, and do something about the CP, groomers, racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia on this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have mixed feelings about this app. Its been a rough past year and a half. Basically it seems like everyone has tiktok now, so you may think, oh I should download it too You might want to consider some things, first of all tiktok is very ADDICTIVE a lot of people spend all of their free time on it (Im and guilty of doing this sometimes.) which isnt great because its pretty much a toxic environment which I will explain, there are all sorts of people on tiktok and of course like all social medias you never know who is behind that profile picture/account, whatever. This give people the opportunity to be very toxic in the comments without people knowing who they actually are, Also the comments have absolutely no filter, whatsoever even though this app is rated 12+. Even though they will take inappropriate videos down, (like naked body parts, extreme gory, etc.) You can still be exposed to these things before they have the chance to be taken down. You may think its a good idea to download tiktok because it seems fun, and you think you will enjoy it, but honestly I would advise anyone to just stay away from it and not get sucked into the hole. Same goes for basically and social media, maybe not YouTube, I find YouTube helps me relax and calm down. Anyway back on topic, you are not going to get any perks from it and there is a BIG chance you will either be exposed to inappropriate stuff or have to deal with toxic people. So yeah, its better for your mental and physical health to just stay away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok loves spying on you. Do not install this app, it tries to collect as much data as it possibly can to spy on you on behalf of advertisers and the Chinese government, which is heavily involved in the parent company of this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy issue. If you like to get your data stolen by China then this is the app for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing privacy. This is one of the worst app i have ever use this. Because they are taking all your privacy and location from other app also. Please guys be safe from this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app takes your IP adress,Creditcard,Phone #,Pictures,The passwords you own, Do not download or else your Info will be Leaked to the world",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DONT DOWNLOAD. This is a China-based app, and they will steal your information. RATE IT ONE STAR to take this app down. This is a China-based app, Tiktok has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China, according to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court on Dec 2, 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Explained. Ok so the app is made by a Chinese company, the company itself means no harm. However, the Chinese government can see and monitor every app that is made in China. Therefore the Chinese government can get your personal info. This is because they want to make sure their countrys citizens are safe. However this information about us could be used in a bad way. I would recommend getting funamate instead. I hope this was helpful.~Yui",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My fav app turned to my biggest frustration.. this app is pro . I was reluctant to download Tik Tok for so long because I thought it was a childrens app but ever since I have and have found like-minded people I literally do not use Facebook or hardly any other social media platforms. TikTok has taught me so much on so many different things but The censorship has gotten out of control and my account has been shadow band for almost 5 months now I have emailed TikTok multiple times with no response, I have not gotten a community guidelines violation during the past 5 months that I have been taken off the FYP intentionally. I hope that the censorship will stop, ironically one of my older videos that was banned for a community guidelines violation that I appealed and lost and it was randomly restored within the past couple of days but I didnt get any type of notification from TikTok about it or why they had changed their mind. The last correspondence I got from TikTok was them saying that my appeal had been denied yet the video was restored and I have no idea how long its been back up because I wasnt really paying attention but it was definitely within the last week. I will not stop emailing and contacting TikTok until my account is un-shadow banned. Do NOT join the creator fund if any of your content is considered controversial and yes Im talking politics, even if you are completely unbiased and neutral. Ive seen so many people lose their accounts simply because they were conservative and recently, many videos were circulating from people that had the word conservative in their username who had gotten a notification from TikTok that they needed to change their username and that by not doing so they risked losing their account. Please do better TikTok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tik tok. I like the app and the information it allows, but I dont like the censorship when ppl are speaking freely. This app should allow its viewers to have real content, not controlled still by the government or tiktok. Open platforms are made for communication and open discussions, and people feelings are not needing to be spared. Their needs to be accountable adults, holding non accountable adults accountable. Revealing the lies and the deception from every place around the world. Sharing our true truths no more lies and excuses, true disclosure. Tiktok gives that to a degree, no more lies, no more censoring, and no more pandering to the government and I would have given a 5 star.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Care for privacy. If you care for your privacy, dont use this app. Simply nothing but chinese govt analytics tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It hands your data to random people who dont need it. I didnt use this app much as it is so the fact it wants my data to hand around like a baby I deleted it straight away if you havent got this app yet do not get it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why this privacy. Hey, Why you changed this privacy policy? Did anyone asked you guys. I had a bad breakup and my ex forgot to block me from Tiktok..i was so happy to see her videos and now you change the privacy settings. You are such a bad. I hate you guys. How i gonna see her? why you did this to me?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chinese spyware. This app sells your personal information to the Chinese government. Dont get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRIVACY NIGHTMARE. This app is basically malware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ridiculous Policies. Me and my friends created an account on TikTok, its been running for over a month and we had around 80k likes on the accountWe then come on this morning to find our account has been taken down due to misuse yet wed had no previous warnings and now have lost all our videosThis is disgusting, if wed had a warning we would of immediately taken down any videos that were going against the TikTok guidelines however you have decided to just take it down straight away despite there being no explicit contentWe had been using this account as something to do while lockdown was happening and now we dont even want to go near TikTok because of this stupid error, having no warning before just losing videos that took a lot of time and effortThis policy is disgraceful and I urge it to be taken seriously as this could happen to young children who dont realise they are liable to loosing all the time theyve invested in this app, there are thousands of other accounts that provided the exact same content as we did yet are not banned Get it back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I use it all day. Both as a creator and a consumer of content I am on tiktok 90% of the day, only thing is the app should be more mindful about account deletion and suspension",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data. Look I love tik tok its honestly a great app, good memes and just funny stuff. But its alarming to me of how much of my data the app actually has access too. I understand we live in a world where data and privacy no longer belongs to us but still I sometimes search things up on my computer and all of a sudden similar things pop up on tik tok... they also can literally go through anything on my phone they have access to all the phone hardware. Overall great app just stop stealing so much of our data and breaching our privacy.(Im talking to you China) ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About my TikTok. Well I think its amazing u can have a account that is private or not but I have one and its the best thing I have ever did I honestly love this app and made friends and more things &lt;3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SHUT IT DOWN. Tiktok takes all your private information and when your not on the app it still runs even if you close it collecting your email, location and other stuff and it even scans your face please shut this app down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"someone looking out for yalls safety. DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD. THIS. APP. PLEASE READ THISthis app (tiktok) is used by the chinese goverment to spy on your phone. it has added to your location,messages,camera,location,microphone,emails,phone numbers, everything it has access to these because when you download the app and make your account, it asks you for permission to use your contacts, camera,microphone,photos, and location. (literally you dont even need to use your location on this app so BIG RED FLAG.) this is 100% real even the usa congress goverment encouraged users of the app to delete it. please everyone do not use this app jsut for ur safety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing. TikTok is so social and amazing and I spend endless hours every day on the platform, its 12 and over but if you keep your account private it is so safe, its an awesome app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tik Tok. There  have been rumours about Tik Tok stealing your information and data whilst you watch the 15 second videos. I was quite worried that the app has been stealing my info. So for a while I had the app deleted from my phone. But, I did some more research and it turns out the app actually just steals the same amount of info and data any other social media app does. So there is nothing really to worry about.Overall, a really great and funny app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good as an app but takes all data. The app itself is fine but the amount of data they take horrendous and absurd u can look in the data they take mentioned by Apple below plus the fact they can see your OS they paste your clipboard know whether your jailbroken the devices on your network and other stuff it is ridiculous do NOT get the app if u want all your data stolen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad content it hacks your account and range your all info. not good. and it&#39;s very disgusting app i used ever. no Tik tok. virus in your phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information. sharing information to all friends and families,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got banned . Why is asking for our private information it should only asked for a date of birth and thats it and our username that you want to do but it asked for all of our private information which is really bad I hate this app I got banned I lost 300 followers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BAD UPDATE. if i am above 13 i should be able to control my privacy. tiktok has made my account private and i am about 15, ever since the new update my tiktok will stop on random pages and i have to close tiktok and restart it. bad update, didnt think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Garbage. Stealing personal data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data. TikTok is just shit, they take your personal info and sell it to china",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hack. Got hacked on this app someone stole my account and my personal videos I reported it multiple times in the las month and it just says under review. Tiktok is not taking privacy issues seriously. Very unsafe app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CyberProfiling. Because tiktok is a Chinese app, its forced to share all info it collects on users with the Chinese government. Go watch Moons video on tiktok. Open your eyes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy alert. Chinese app ... shares your personal data with Chinese companies.. do not use the app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tiktok is ruining our society. tiktok is taking your personal information, your text messages, photos, everything and using them. they are lowering our attention span.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spyware used on you. This is app is literally spying on you. So unless you want a Chinese company tracking your information, stay away from this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The worst. People are saying TikTok can know your location and personal information. Even my teacher says this. When reporting someone it does not take it seriously and that when I first got TikTok it does not allow me to make an account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"info. lol, this app is so trash it just steals your personal info. if you are wanting to get this app dont, its filled with cringe, homophobes, racist people, sexist people and more. I hate this app, I hope it gets deletedps its a Chinese spyware ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About my TikTok. Well I think its amazing u can have a account that is private or not but I have one and its the best thing I have ever did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About my TikTok. Well I think its amazing u can have a account that is private or not but I have one and its the best thing I have ever did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok is not a good idea. Most damaging and horrible app ever created. Personal data collection terms are incredibly invasive and will negatively affect your life and overall well being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why I dont like TikTok. I said the writing and posting TikTok when I was seven and I thought it was cool and then I figured out that they just want your FMH information and they just want everything that you can get out of you so they can just hack into your phone and stuff thats just what happened to me they asked me for my date of birth my signature my you know personal stuff and I just almost got banned but then I told them I would report them but didnt start so these just stopped and then I just yeah so I hope you guys just take care of that please and thank you they just want your info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Delete      ASAP . this app is stealing all our information without our consent including our locationTikToK app is pullng data from our sim to show us relevant language videos - thats crazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didnt Like it. Used it for days. Then I came to know that they have all the access to our data and they can or I think they are manipulating our data against us. Idont  want them to use my data so delete it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCP controlled. Remove this app from your phone. This company is controlled by the CCP. Anything they want they can take it. Whatever info they desire. Dont trust anything from a company from China. Update: Theyre not monitored thru an American company anymore. Theyre brain washing your kids with stupid stuff. Make your kids remove this garbage. PS. Taiwan is a country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great information. Dont sensor the posts and videos because people need to hear what is said due to the biased media and government. This platform actually Unites the country and makes us stronger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be careful. read all the articles about tiktok and how they suppress stuff its so true. the algorithm is too good makes it so you literally spend others without noticing. if youre insecure dont get this app bc itll ruin any small piece of confidence you have left. honestly be careful its so toxic it used to be so fun and light hearted now its so racist sexist and pro ana. also people expose too much of their personal lives like people forgot employers and unis can find their tiktoks. the culture of other sharing everything for clout is so toxic. like i love the internet and tech dont get me wrong but tiktok is so toxic i get why now that parents dont want their kids on it (if youre kid is honestly under 15 dont let them get this itll destroy them tbh bc of the toxic ness),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"myeeerere. cool app, but I don&#39;t like getting my data leaked to the Chinese government",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ello. Tik Tok can take personal information off ur devices      The truth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great. For the first few years of TikTok I never paid it no mind nor thought or cared to do so. Im a licensed electrician and when a supervisor or foreman is given another worker to help them they are called  Helpers . I had a helper that would literally honest to god watch TikTok All day and continue working. I finally wanted to know what this social media platform was to have someones attention at that magnitude. Of course Ill never be to the point where I have to watch it all day long. But after downloading the app and also uploading some of my content that I also have on YouTube to my TikTok account its also a great way to get your other platforms noticed and traffic brought to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy is no go. Such a great tracking app for Chinese government. Well done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy and settings needs help. My acc got hacked and that person removed all my followers and deleted my most viewed and liked videos. And I accidentally made my age under 13 and now tiktok restricted my setting and privacy so no one can duet... now no one likes my videos. But overall its ok. And has great content... from other user ofc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good App but ppl get away with EVERYTHING. The app itself is quite good and popular. Yet there are countless accounts that for example, sexualise and idolise Richard Ramirez, Ted Bundy and other criminals. I have reported numerous accounts that contain content like this bc it is despicable. I report and they say theyre are no violations I dont think they actually care, but what is even more stupid is they take down videos that arent bad at all claiming there are violations. Absolutely despicable letting content like this upload to TikTok. Very disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals data. Nobody should have this Chinese spyware installed on their phone. Before downloading look up how much info it takes from you and how much is necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok. Banned my account for one policy I forgot about its a good app but you shouldnt do that Id like my account back and until hen I will not have tiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok is fraud. Please delete your accounts they are taking your information and they scan your face .even when your not on the app they can see what your doing on your phone or tablet/iPad.if you dont believe me check on google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its great and all but. I love TikTok its the best social media platform so far but what always happens is people accounts get banned because people report them for no reason. I hope you understand and can maybe fix it a bit. Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tracking and homophobic/transphobic. This app tracks its users and take their info, its also knows to delete account with lgbtq+ stuff and usually when an account talks about china, the app tracking you, Lgbtq+ stuff, calls someone out, or has very left views and spreads info about what the government is doing it deletes their account",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Awesome stuff this Tiktok. Love this platform, Im still learning how to use it. Theres so much information on here that is very important to know especially during these dreadful times. I stopped watching tv and listening to the FAKE NEWS. Thank you for this platform its integrity is better than most social media networks. Aloha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Look. Theres problems. The app is really good, but there is some MAJOR problems with how you handle the guidelines. I have seen Inappropriate tiktoks that have DEFINITELY violated the guidelines that are still up to this day. But then theres tiktoks of someone showing their cat chilling on the couch and that gets taken down for Hate speech I suggest you hire people to actually look over tiktoks that are reported to see if they should be taken down or not. Also another thing is my niece deleted the app from my phone, when I reinstalled it and opened it to put in my number to log into my account it says to many attempts, Try later IM SORRY THAT IM FORGETFUL AND MY NEICE TAKES MY PHONE A LOT. But that shouldnt be there FIX. THESE. PROBLEMS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nonsensical regulations. Tiktok needs to get its act together. You can find some horrifyingly inappropriate things on this app, but none of them get banned. But god forbid someone talks about social justice or marginalized groups, their videos get removed for community guidelines violations. I don\'t know who decides to ban accounts or if it\'s just all automatic, but they need to fix it. Anyone can get an account banned by mass reporting it, even if the account hasn\'t actually done anything wrong. On top of this issue, Tiktok\'s customer support doesn\'t do anything about it. Nothing. It doesn\'t matter how much proof you have that you did nothing wrongyou\'ll be lucky if you even get a response. Tiktok knows how much power it has within younger generations and it is taking advantage of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Creepy app. Why is everything you do/own/have linked to you on this app except for usage data? Also, I know it is supposed to be good marketing but this app drags you in and absorbs your brain. By getting this app you are not only committing to being tracked but you are also going to have to be prepared to give all of your time to the app; however, it is a good way for people to express themselves, but then people get hate for doing so. TikTok also shortens your attention span so if you are like me and care about your life then you will delete this app because you dont need it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Huge privacy concerns. tiktok has been allegedly selling pictures on private accounts to companies meaning that anyone can access tiktoks just made for family and friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urlebirdy is taking my info. Yh the reason I gave this review was because another company has my info and I am not happy that they arent getting rid of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scam. This app is a big scam it steals all your data secretly. Delete it now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app but security tools needs improvement. TikTok has an array of amazing content creators sharing information on various subjects from house cleaning to mental health. The app itself is pretty straightforward to use. The reason I rated 4 stars is because privacy and security tools need improving. I have also found the support team were absolutely no help when reporting a troll account using my name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The greatest app. People are so friendly and TikTok values your privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep our identity safe. Many would say dont do tiktok because they may hack your accounts. Please Tiktok keep us all safe from identity thief and please keep it wholesome for all user. Filter those that are showing their nudity or using inappropriate words or misleading information because there are also kids using it. I would still give you 5 star because you help me with my anxiety and depression. You are one medium to keep me distracted from panic ir depression. And I found new friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrible. It steals your mobile data and takes all your personal information DO NOT GET IT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom to express opinions freely. While Twitter and FB continue to constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY lock me out of my accounts and restrict my freedom of speech and expression, TikTok has remained an open unbiased platform for all of us to post and share our opinions openly no matter what colour, gender, race, political views, etc. It honestly remains the leader in social media in my opinion for allowing world issues to be brought forward into the light for the rest world to judge for ourselves.~M1SC~P.S.If any editors actually read this, I could really use some help getting my music some traction. Ive tried my hardest for 4+ years to make it, but I now no longer have the money to invest into marketing and promoting because of covid. One of my songs actually made it to 80,000+ streams. Anyways, I know its a long shot and Im not one to ask for help, but I could honestly use it. Ive already lost everything else. Stay Blessed either way TikTok and thank you for keeping your platform unbiased Spotify: M1SC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tik Tok. There  have been rumours about Tik Tok stealing your information and data whilst you watch the 15 second videos. I was quite worried that the app has been stealing my info. So for a while I had the app deleted from my phone. I am still worried that Tik Tok might be stealing private info and data and I am stuck whether if I should download the app againBut otherwise than the fact Tik Tok might be banned in the USA and could potentially be stealing information without consent the content on there is really funny and entertaining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Useless, dont bother wasting your data. Thousands of people are having the same issue &amp; yet theyve done nothing. After hours of hard work, I posted a video, all content was within community guidelines. TikTok removes it for breaching these guidelines. I appeal it &amp; state that Im within my rights to post this video &amp; they need to provide the specifics as to why theyve removed it. No actual response, just a refusal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trash. i will no longer be using this app due to the fact that i cant send my friends tiktoks. this is embarrassing on your behalf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tiktok. I love your app and love the time you make for the updates I am a bit sad my account got banned but ig it had to be done but I love your so much ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spying on you. Dont download it. It will spy on you guys. It will take data from your phone. May be one day it will clean ur banks too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing however. I highly admire this app, as it has been a collective boredom breaker during lockdown 2020. It appears to be the same-level of respect as other social medias, example Instagram. However, there are certain differences which highly make a change. I have had an amazing experience with this app, and I think that nobody needs more than 8 accounts on a device at one time, which is also admirable. What I dont like is the amount of storage that this app takes. I have kept this app on my tablet for over a year now, and it has ended up at 4.15GB. On my phone, its ended at 3.97GB. My phone has very little storage, and my tablet doesnt have much more. This isnt REALLY an issue, but it is preventing me from having tiktok on my phone and other devices. I guess that this isnt really something that could be fixed, but it would just be nice to have this app and it not use so much data.. apart from that minor detail, I love this app. And I do happen to have an account with quite a few followers myself So, I guess thats something. Anyway, thank you, and have a good day if youre reading this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok is a scam. It steals your data and takes it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikToc. This app needs to be shut down, our heavily monitored. There are far too many people posting dangerous stuff. The creators should be ashamed of themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Privacy. This app is very entertaining, but it is not very secure. It can see your face, which is wayyyyyyy bad. So I don&#39;t recommend this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just dog water. Why is asking for our private information it should only asked for a date of birth and thats it and our username that you want to do but it asked for all of our private information which is really bad I hate this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont feel safe on the platform. really good app. but in my opinion i dont feel safe on the app. even with a private account i dont feel safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Safety and privacy. I want to be able to take my phone number out. Ive been getting calls from all across my province and I dont like it. I dont feel safe on tik tok anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The worst social media platform ever. I am beyond disappointed about the terrible people who use and run this platform. I mean, child predators, people doing stupid things for popularity. The moderators track your location and dont promote videos from disabled people too Tiktok is absolutely terrible and deserves to be removed from the app store",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok need to improve security of its users. I really love it. As a feed back I suggest Tiktok to improve their security feature and with a valid email or phone number confirmation an account creation should be allowed to protect others, the safety and integrity of this site Overall recommend to everyone Tik Tok takes credit if providing a platform to share our feelings and everyday life experiences Love to all Regards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont get this app. SPY-WARE from the China Gov. This app is a data collection service disguised as social media. The Chinese government is using this app to track all of you and gather all the data about you and your friends/family.I REPEAT. DONT GET THIS SPYWARE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delete this app now. Not because its stealing your information, but because its ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It stills information. My Id was shared with so many people. And much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Uploading. So yea the app is great, seeing everyones great content most of the time, but when I want to put some of my content out there, for example some harmless memes that are generally just for laughs, suitable for kids to watch and nothing is racist or anything, but TikTok seems to take it down for community guidelines ? For wat ? It doesnt even tell me wat part of the video is against the guidelines ? Nothing is wrong with it anyways, this has happened twice now, even tho I see people on TikTok breaking their bones or falling down hills on the bikes causing serious injuries and it just comes With a disclaimer? Mine doesnt and even if so nothing needs a disclaimer anyways, fix your app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Identity Theft  be Careful. People were using my screen name with a character added to the end of it and a screenshot photo of my face that was on my accountWhen I reported it to TikTok as someone pretending to be meit came back as no violation foundPlease be aware that the site is NOT safe and has an overwhelming number of accounts that follow you and if you click the link in their profile it brings you to pornography even though the platform allows children Children are to be at least 13 but if you click on their account, its clear that they are much younger.I had an account that I went live on for an hour each evening with between 300-500 individuals in the live.When my reports of pornography came back with 80% coming back no violation when the majority of my live were children as we played WordscapesI was disheartened with the App.When I learned (a friend was in the persons live and spending money on them) that TikTok allowed people to basically steal my identity by creating an account with a screenshot photo of my face, using my name and having a screen name exactly like mine with a 1 attached to the end, I ended up deleting my account.Please be aware and stay safe.For all the parents out there, please click on all the accounts FOLLOWING your children Report the pornography accounts and keep your children safe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What Tiktok is hiding from you. They get information about people on this app and is owned by China 10 cents thing DONT download this app for your safety,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop leaking drafts. Im very concerned about the privacy and service of of some users using this platform. It has been brought to my attention that somehow, a tiktok users drafts have been leaked to the public. This is very concerning and not something that should be taken lightly. Its disgusting and an absolute disgrace, nobodys private videos should be shown to the public. Its very stupid that the workers for this app somehow let someones private content become leaked. Its horrendous and makes me sick. Nobody EVER consented to letting those videos become leaked. So I ask with all due respect, watch your platform. CAREFULLY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok but. TikTok is good, you get to see cool art, watch tutorials, and have a laugh, but there is somethings that need to be stopped for example; inappropriate profile-pics, rude comments and toxic videos. Also I feel like my information isnt safe, you have to enter your birthday, age, pay account (if your buying things) and more, so thats why I deleted it, make sure if your young ask someone if you can buy it, please.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"security management. literally it tracks you and finds all your data and info, sends it to a software. and its so bad it makes people want to commit suicide and silences lgbtq+ people by banning them and deleting their videos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tik tok is the best app for creators to get Paid. Pros: Tiktok overall is a fantastic app when it comes to growing your account and being discovered. you can literally have zero followers & Go viral By following a few simple Steps. If you are serious about your craft and brand, You can Build out a Blue Print to compensation Thru Tiktok from Going 1K and now during live stream you can receive gifts from supporters with a 50/50 split (tik tok cut), 2nd you reach 10k followers you can apply for the tik tok creator fund earning money off your content (not on facebook twitter or instagram do you make money off your content for years  Only youtube with ads) to the big advance At 100k you can apply for the tik tok Market Place where Big businesses can reach out to you if they need you for promotion. This trajectory can literally replace your current 9 to 5 and never have to work again. that's how innovative and forward thinking this app is. Follow @scoobyrawpodcast @americancloutman to turn your passion into a business Im living proof Cons: like most social media apps or huge conglomerate companies worth billions of dollars there is no dedicated customer service video calling live chatting or call center to contact for any of your issues. there is a huge flaw in their artificial intelligence & not enough humans on the pay roll. I literally took TickTock three days to respond to a live stream mayor a live stream or who committed suicide how can you be worth billions of dollars and not have a direct contact when it gets to this extreme level. What exactly is the face recognition and breach of privacy for if you can't even catch suicide instantly or at least within 24 hours as I digress . when it comes to their reporting systems especially during live stream where the coded bias is based on how much the viewer can aggravate the user to force the algorithm to agree with whatever report is sent in and cause a content violations or worst A 7 day or longer ban with literally ZERO EXPLANATION MOST TIMES. Only because I'm a social media marketing genius I've created over 12 pages in which I've gotten to a high enough social status where trolls and hackers don't affect me as much but 99.9% of TickTock does not have the gifts that I possess so this causes a huge problem amongst the live stream and content creator community you need a dedicated customer service center. Conclusion: tiktok is now rivaling youtube as the greatest competition to the transformation of wealth For creators world wide in the world you can actually turn your passion into a profitable business beyond your current salary 10 Fold with the right amount of dedication and motivation knowledge and drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Private Account. My Account is private and still you guys are sharing my information on the Internet please get this sorted out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avoid using this app. To all my fellow Tik-Tok Users around the Federal government of United Stated have ordered to uninstall Tik-Tok on all its employees Personal and Government Devices. If it involves government I feel there is a suspicious threat of data getting leaked from our device. please uninstall this app immediately to safe guard your Privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wouldnt download. The Chinese government is taking your personal data from this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok review. I like this app. Hope the app developers dont steal the data from my phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good but needs some changes. Ok so tiktok is a great app but the privacy setting isnt the best, Im trying to change my number that backs up my account but I cant because that is my old number and no longer have access to it and my email is already taken by another account. Its really annoying and scared that I will lose my account one day if I forget my password. So please tiktok change the setting make it easier to change things up :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty good but. This app is amazing and fun to be on The only problem is, when you report something the customer services dont reply. Ive reported two problems. The first one I figured out on my own because there was no reply, the second one I sent twice and have still gotten no reply. TikTok has also put up images of my videos and profile on Google WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I have reported this and yet the images are still up. Ive changed my username, Ive changed my profile photo and now all I can do is delete my videos to get them off Google. I was having a great time until this happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is good. If some of the reviews say they take your personal info or stuff like that, read the community guidelines. This app is good to go on when your bored. I recommend",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok changed my life. I finally found my people As an entertainer, I have been able to connect with people in new and better ways than other social media sites. It took me a while to figure it out but once I started uploading a lot, things have taken off for me in ways they never did on the other platforms. I know this sounds like some paid review, but it's not ha It was the right platform at the right time for me, and I'm GenX",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Platform info. Loving this platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Months of content gone. This is insane I had to delete the application off my phone because I had to get my phone fixed and all the drafts of created videos deleted off tiktok. Months of content just erased, no warning. I think there should be some disclaimer for that.. its just disappointing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Community Guidelines . I'll admit. Tiktok is quite a good app, But a lot of things that are HOT GARBAGE. like community guidelines. Community guidelines  are DUMB in all cap. What it does is that it just BANS you for no reason possible. And they can't do anything about it. This happened to me and I was DEVASTATED by what I saw. I was BANNED from tiktok for NO actual reason. So tiktok please unban all the accounts that you banned for community guidelines and notify them once your done. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unnecessary. Ive been on my account Ive been banned before over little thing and I dont know why Ive had notifications saying my account will be deleted and its unfair for me not to have my account but all the people that post inappropriate thing get to stay and you get people showing nudity and still visible on this app and yes I am old enough for tiktok Im  16 so I dont know why you guys make false accusations so please unban me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whys it take my financial data?. Great addictive app but would like to know what financial data its taking off my phone. Ive never purchased anything on TikTok or seen a way of doing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TT. Get to post things. And good privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WARNING PEOPLE. TICTOK IS SPYWARE THEY STEAL YOUR DATA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asha Huntsmans Review. I love TikTok They have made a lot of improvement on there privacy policy and more Thanks so much for helping our community and gain a lot of love and helpful tips ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SOOO BAD. I used to love TikTok until I found out it was owned by Chinese government which use spyware on everything they use and thats why President Trump is banning it personally I advise no one to use it if you want to keep you information private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok review ( PLEASE READ ). Hello there , I have decided to make this just as my opinion about the app and its content . Ive had the app for about a year in general but my account is a bit new considering I made it in December of 2020 . For one the report feature does not properly work as they dont actually work when I do come across something disgusting . TikTok never really comes back to you saying if they sorted the situation or if your report has been acknowledged and theyve looked at the situation . Secondly the  scroll page  or the  fyp  page isnt the best as you dont know what type of content might pop up , could be something cute and wholesome or can be something disgusting . I now the app is rated 12+ but I do now younger kids on this app and if I was a parent I wouldnt really want them to be scrolling threw something that is unpredictable . Thirdly the users , some of the people on the app and community are toxic( Im not saying everyone just done )  . Again when you report them nothing happens . I honestly think that some people should just be banned for some amounts of days not permanently . Fourthly the content , this is probably the same as second , first and also third but when I do talk to the user about it they just say  oh if you dont like it just scroll  or something like that . I have recently found some IMVU content from an account that shows sexually things and strip clubs . I personally dont want any kids looking at this as they might get the wrong idea . I dont think all content should of course get banned or taken down . Just the ones that are about these topics like animal abuse especially in gold fish like they  accidentally  flush their fish down the toilet . Thank you for taking the time to read this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UNINSTALL THIS APP ASAP . This app steals all your personal information and even credit card details, your IP address and provides a lot of intelligence data to the CCP Just run as far as you can from this app &amp; save yourself and your privacy ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop stealing our data. Stop it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stalkers. People stalk you and can access youre personal information inside and outside of the app would not recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trash and sneaky. The worst app on earth it also gives away private info to the Chinese government so if you like your personal info dont buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok has its own agenda. Tiktok needs a truthtok, once where human rights and freedom of expression is not taken down. Ive had over 40 MILLION views and everyone finds me and we are ALL sick of this. I wont stop so you may as well leave me alone and remember that clearly the people want to increase their knowledge and not stay stupid to ppl doing the same thing.   Why dont you make an app for us? Where no censorship for freedom of expression and free speech.  I dont even speak I use the sounds that YOU provide.   Whats wrong with showing government documents; its literally available on the internet.    We want #TruthTok ....     ps why are children being trafficked In India via your app, I just read an article on that #becsnewsroom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing people information. This app is from the COVID 19 starters and is stealing people information and personal stuff so if you want to protect your information NEVER USE THIS APP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Steals your data then sells it to the Chinese Communist Party. If you download this app, you are supporting the suppression and indoctrination of billions of people as well as the torture and organ harvesting of tens of millions of people.It is an abomination that this bastion of Chinese cyber infiltration and cultural manipulation was ever allowed into the AppStore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wrong choices. DEAR UK TIKTOK , dont set our accounts to private or else I will be deleting the app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gone overload with guidelines. Tiktok is amazing like its so good but I have had 6 accounts deleted 6 From doing nothing I didnt even violate any guidelines whatsoever tiktok please sort this out as this is not ok you should be doing much better as a big platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is app Spys on you. This app spys on you it records everything that happens on your phone and sends it to the FBI and if anything bad happens you will be reported to the FBI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do something creator about this. I just downloaded the TikTok a few months ago but I never used or uploaded or anything bad please do something about because I just got message of the app violations of Whatever is but I dont used it and I dont know if someone got in the on my account,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok is Spyware. If you dont value your personal information and youre okay with your private information in the hands of the Chinese (and probably Chinese government) go nutsI enjoyed this app until they were ONCE AGAIN caught taking private information through underhanded means. Apple caught them red handed. Should be removed from the app store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want real information I suggest you download TikTok right now and get off fake media. Its a community family and friends sure nothing but the truth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok Updates, Clout And Account. Hey I love TikTok and literally use it for over 6  hours at least a day but sometimes it can be a bit challenging to figure things out.I have seen so many people using filters or having updates, and I dont seem to have them. I am not sure if its about your country youre in or its my phone, but I honestly think it would be helpful to have this changed so everyone gets it at the same time.I have tried to set my friend up with an account and she is 18, I put her birthday in and it say youre not eligible could you guys see whats happening.Also, promoting small creators who put effort an value, into drawing, makeup, edits,food etc. So others could have some attention. ( I am not saying this for myself but for others I know)I love TikTok my opinion) thanks for making TikTok - TikTok user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It literally takes all of your personal stuff, everything on your phone your search history your photos your texts everything and keeps it it doesnt sell but if the Chinese government wants the info they just take it and you accept all of this because it is hidden away in the terms of agreement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ok listen I know that this may track some of your data or whatever but theres Apps made for literally protecting your personal Data like an App Jumbo that I would definitely recommend, but besides that it really isnt too bad. Because it can be entertaining and yes I know there can be a lot of toxicity and inappropriate stuff but not like your just gonna search up hot naked lady, (I hope )In the App but there are still some TikTokers who help with anxiety,depression,panic attacks,etc. And some very nice people on the App. And on this App you can make new friends,make videos, and you can even watch your friend/ familys Videos. So for me this App is a must have especially on a boring Sunday afternoon, Have a great day,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deleted account and app. I deleted my account and app because the moderators wont take down videos of bullying and harassment of vulnerable people with learning difficulties and mental health issues. Also, as Ive been reading on the comments here, they ARE deleting videos of larger people which amounts to fat shaming. Shame on TikTok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DELETE NOW. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WATCH YOU THOUGH THIS APP IT WILL KNOW YOUR PERSONAL INFO AND IF U DONT TRUST ME SEARCH IT UP ON YOUTUBE DONT TAKE THIS RISK IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE IT TELL THEM TO DELETE IT NOWWWWWW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harmful content allowed to stay up. So much pro-Ed content on TikTok and no matter how many times you report accounts theyre allowed to stay up. Its not what you want people to be seeing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do better. Banning everyone from the app, no customer service, one of the most if not most toxic social media platforms I have ever been on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love TikTok. Love this platform. Out of all Social Media TikTok seems to be the least controlling of what we put out there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Concerned Parent. In this era, your involvement and access to social platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter arent just cool ways to communicate to people anymore- but a social commodity. Imagine the videos in your recommended list on YouTube, but realms more addictive and spastic to view. Thats whats been rotting the minds of an entire generation.  Breaking the Boundaries: TikTok has no ethic of parental-child consent. I emailed them about deleting my daughters account due to her involvement in this cesspool, and Im pretty sure it still exists. I also caught her with a video where she cut off a wad of her own hair, just for some virtual attention. She recorded last week. (The TikTok watermark was on it) Seeing such degenerative content being posted from your own child due to the nature and environment on this app made me feel violated.  Children dont just feel tolerated nor accepted on this platform, but encouraged to get involved. (Faking your age and making an account is extremely easy for anyone) This is severely problematic. Merits of TikTok:- Easy to use, enjoyable, and overall good video editing service- Some good videos from select people Cons of TikTok:- Contributes to decline in mental health- Deteriorates your attention span- Lack of child-parental consent- Influential with the issues of teen suicide, depression, bullying, etc.- Outlandish, problematic, and dangerous trends. (Examples: Devious Lick challenge, underage girls showing off their bodies and being humiliated for attention.)- Apparent involvement in being owned by a Chinese company that collects and sells your data that can be inspected and used by the CCP. (National Security concerns)- Nature and environment of its community- Unfair double-standardsInconclusion: TikTok may be enjoyable for a 20+ y/o with no life, but its affects, significance, influence, and content are detrimental toall; and quite frankly I dont want my kids going behind my back and posting terrible videos. I wish I could manage to put parental software on my daughters iPad, but for now; Im keeping it away from her for awhile so she doesnt use this app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HATE IT. I love this app... but... IT FREAKING MADE MY ACCOUNT PUBLIC And I change it to private and then I reload and surprise surprise It public AGAIN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guidelines & Banning. I used to love this app it was great, it was friendly. Now however.. I got banned on an account called @.txddycharlss I was banned for no apparent reason. I appealed my ban and they emailed me back with they couldnt help. I had done nothing to offend anyone, I edited videos and spread positivity if thats how you get banned Im not surprised so many people kill themselves over the hate they get on here. I once witnessed a live stream, these 2 lovely girls where talking about something off topic to race. They get on the fyp and bam Hate starts piling in, people where being racist, sexist, hateful, telling them to kill themselves etc The girls brushed off the hate and kept talking about the topic they were on before the hate came through. However, it didnt stop. The girls 1 year old nephew came into the live... the haters called them kiddy fiddlers, the girls immediately pro claimed the accusation and got banned from live streaming.Its disgusting, tiktok is always pro claiming that this app is safe and reliable when in actual fact its full of people telling you to off yourself/ kill yourself and banning you for no reason. Oh but the haters oh no theyre still on their pages with 1 followers trolling Sincerely,Me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont use tiktok. DO NOT USE THIS APP IT STEALS UR INFO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pls read. Good app overall, I think it should definitely have more privacy options for example if you dont want to see inappropriate content there should be a setting for that I think a lot more people would let their teenagers get the app if it was more private and had more restrictions on what people can post aka. No evident inappropriate footage, No posting pictures or videos of violence ect I like TikTok but it needs to have more ways of banning people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Useless, steal my information. Its not safe at all, steal all your data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spyware and bad content. Full of fake content and is a spyware taking personal information. How is this even aloud on the AppStore?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Report for nothing. TikTok bann account for no reasons , and my friends and I did nothings. Some sexual person are on this app and there acc stay there. TikTok is being bad for everyone and toxic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really?. its really dumb that i cant post whatever i want to my PRIVATE posts. currently banned from posting bc i made a video on tik tok and posted it to private simply to save it to my camera roll. if youre gonna make a deal about it let me save it straight from drafts and not have to post it at all. the privacy policy on this app is dumb ive read it over and over again and have not been able to understand half of it as theyre giving us as little detail as possible while still abiding by the law, this is a kids app you think they know what those privacy policies mean when worded like that? either let me post whatever i want to private and review it when i change the privacy settings on a post or let me save straight from drafts. the whole policy system is messed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great way to share information. TikTok isnt just a source of entertainment it is also a great source of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Theres no privacy. Its keeps asking me for my phone number & theres lots of people making fun on disability, shame on you, Im reporting this to Apple",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. Before I was able to put on diets and everyone could comment on my videos. And them TikTok put me on private And I cant put my comments back on or duets and its really frustrating This is such a stupid rule and its so annoying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good. However somethings need to change. I like the app overall its fun and very good for when youre bored. However there have been some issues regarding other people and me. Firstly, the community guidelines needs to improve. I have seen very hateful videos (e.g racist, homophobic, misogynistic and etc)  which are still on tiktok where people can very much see it and its very accessible for children to learn the wrong things. Also I have seen many people WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING wrong and theyre getting banned for no reason while the hateful TikToks are still up, its not fair. Secondly I have changed my number in 2020 and recently I realised that I still havent changed my number on tiktok therefore I decided to change it but in order for me to change my number I need to get a code that is going to be sent to my old number which I dont have access to. I contacted tiktok for this and they gave questions to prove that Im actually the owner of my account and they still havent replied me. It has been almost one week so I told tiktok that no one has done anything yet. Then, they sent me the same questions again which I answered and I still havent got any replies ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"READ THIS BEFORE DOWNLOADING. GUIDE ~This is a great app, but be aware of the people on it, Ive been bullied on the app and there are really rude hackers Dont send personal information for it can be a terrorist site, there are also some pedofiles on this app Also there can be some people that can share personal information so dont get involved or anythingHow to be safe: make ur account private, only accept people that are safe or you know dont share personal information e.g passwords, age, where you live, etc. and share happiness because everyone needs it in there lifeSigns of terrorist: dont have a profile pic or videos, or a bio Dont accept them or follow them.Types of tiktok accounts: tips/advice, dancing, faceless dancers, aesthetic, famous, fan pages, and youll find out.What not to do: bully, share mean, encourage others to do illegal/bad things, HACK, share inappropriate content, online date, etc HAVE FUN ON TIKTOK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
milenials. this app SPYS ON YOU AND GIVES YOUR INFORMATION TO THE CHINESE COMMIE GOVERMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seemingly unbiased. Its very difficult to find a social media platform that filters all the good info out. TikTok Im sure still filters things they shouldnt but less than other places,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Creepy. They take your personal info and sell it to other websites Delete it now If your dont believe me, check the privacy and terms policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All your data is sent to the Chinese government. Research tiktok and how it sends your data to Chinese government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love it until. So now there r a lot of hackers and scammers that are dangerous a lot of reports saying tiktok steals ur information and sends it to China and a lot of kids go on it including me I just dont think its possibly safe anymore please update privacy settings and add something that only the owner know like an old teachers name or face animal please Ive deleted the app cause of my young age thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it. really bad disgustingly censoring info and using personal data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally delete it. Its so inappropriate and they take your personal stuff and they track you down and ban you from entering your own personal account ban this app the creators are dumbasses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disappointed. i used to love tik tok. i worked hard to make good content for a long time. now with the new policy, because im younger than 16, my account has been changed to private, duets off, and more. i think this is not fair as i have my parents permission to have this platform, i do not need tik tok to force me to make these drastic changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Security Issues. They steal your data and send it back to the CCP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok facts. Its a great app but last time  when I made an account it turns it into private and then it logged me off of all my account so I had to make new accounts and then today I made one and after 1 minute it says it got banned for no reason and it logged me off of one of my other account again, so I lost 2 of my accounts today Im upset still",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love it. This social media platform has the best info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AVOID DOWNLOADING. Complete trash. This application disgusts me. There is not a single place on the web I can browse freely without being harassed by this garbage apps advertisement. Avoid downloading this application at all costs it may seem all fun and games at first but you have no idea how your data is being collected by the developers... who also happen to have enough money to spread their ads on every platform available on the web. This application invades every aspect of your privacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China. TikTok sells your information to China and people on the dark web. They spy on you and collect data from other apps. Dont download if you value your privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its good but. i made my tiktok account private but it keeps on making public so please fix this its very annoying and my account is private for safety reason thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The guidelines. The app is fine its just I did my bio then it got removed for COMMUNITY GUIDELINE VIOLATIONS and I didnt violate anything and all these amazing tiktok creators have been doing nothing wrong AND THEY ARE GETTING VIDEOS TAKEN OFF AND BANNED FOR NO REASON. Ive been banned once and I looked at the guidelines and I didnt violate anything whatsoever. TikTok really need to sort out there guidelines THEY DONT EVEN FOLLOW THEM THEIRSELVES.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SORT THIS OUT NOW. Theres bots on this app, they like your comments and if you click on the link in their bio they can track you/leak your information. I deleted the app in fear. Sort. This. Out. This is a dangerous app be careful. But the app is good itself, just be careful of these bots",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2021 review. This app will get you banned quicker than you signed up for. 1) theres a lot of religious people on this app that will get easy offended at the content you upload. 2) theres minors on this app that get away with wearing bikini tops, and clothing that gets adult females banned. but they&#39;re allowed to show it. 3) asking to get your account unbanned wont get it unbanned they ban you permanently if youve been banned 1x appeal it and theyll keep it banned, you cant even talk to a person support staff dont want to hear your feedback. 4) you upload music thats not on there app and it gets muted and you cant use it. 5) this app is turning more and more into a dating app. As all I see is men asking women for nudes, and women are promoting their Onlyfans accounts and content to get more followers. 6) this app isnt the app it once was back in 2018. Its changed completely and not in a good way. So I recommend not downloading this app. unless you want the TikTok support team to steal your mobile number and email, and never reply to any of your emails and questions As to why they did it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why let the PRA have your phone data ???. The Chinese government basically own this app now .So why have on it your phone?????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better social media experience. I have had all social media platforms. Just a way to protect and see whats my daughters up to #ProtectiveFather This has a better experience and more exciting features. Im addicted now #Tiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is designed to destroy your life. This app destroys your attention span and has been proven in scientific studies to increase rates of depression all while collecting every bit of data it can about you. It collects your likes and dislikes, what apps you have on your phone, your search history on apps other than itself, keystrokes on other apps, your text messages and contacts. This app will collect every single spec of information about your life then turn around and hand it to the Chinese government on a silver platter. TikTok will say this is because of Chinese law rather than the app being heavily developed by the Chinese government and having many government officials on their board of executives. I know this review will most likely be buried under artificial 5 star reviews or just deleted but if I can keep one person from downloading this app or make one person delete this app Ill consider it worth it. I beg you please do not download this app for the betterment of yourself as a human being and to protect the privacy of your daily life from the prying eyes of the Chinese government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But reporting system is rubbish. You can read all of TikToks Community guidelines reading easily and at first it looks good. However they do not actually stick to them. There is plenty of videos and accounts getting reported and nothing happens they say its fine. However videos or accounts of people doing nothing wrong instantly taken down. There is no easy way of getting in contact with TikTok to discuss its issues of safety and community guildlinss. TikTok doesnt care about the safety of its users at all. And this needs to change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please report the user. I tried to report a user for leaking my address and personal information , but tiktok didnt do anything about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok is a virus. There is proof in the terms and conditions that they can send your data to the Chinese government. In addition random people can download your info. Do we want this for our kids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Content creators. There are guidelines that must be followed on this app but that is not the control of TikTok but the control of federal rules and regulations but for the most part we are able to vocalize our opinions and our stands on different issues around the world which makes this an app of freedom and a privilege. This app is a privilege, no constitution and the Bill of Rights are human rights and the rights as American citizens. Lets give TikTok more credit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y DID YOU DO THAT TO ME TIKTOK  read it or you will regret it. OK so anyways you need to get to the Point one time and Im going to do what I did on TikTok yesterday OK so one time I had it a old account which got banned for no reason or maybe my fake friends will keep on reporting you so I got a new phone so I made a new account and yeah lets go to the park today that I got banned so one time Ill bored and people keep on adding TikTok to like the videos shows since everybody will keep adding TikTok I was just looking at TikTok to look and people just keep on saying some stuff what I wouldnt say because I didnt want to get banned while saying something so why would you look at the videos then on a time night time that was when I was just still on my phone making a video and it just said you got banned logged out and now when I was starting to cry because why would you be on me with a P whole tire seven-year-old five-year-olds even some people be trying to send me so links about sex and stuff yeah yeah and TickTock if you are reading this yeah I am 10 years old and why would you even do that to me when it is so much people to do it do it why would you even been a girl who passed away so anyways I quit crying and I deleted the app and download it again trying to do it and it still wouldnt even let me in and I even had a whole Nother account but it wasnt showing it wouldnt let me go on it because on my old phone it will just say your account got banned go to a different account so I have to go to that different account so now its not even working thats why I hate TickTock and then I hate the links like what will you keep on burning me knowing that other people it is literally strippers on there and you guys do not download that app because it is not worth it like why would they do that like every single time when I have a account for years I mean for a year it will always be getting banding  people and like it is 2020 to get ready to stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zuckerberg no.2. This app steals your data. (search history, contacts and your texts/dms) TikTok has been banned in numerous countries including America for spying on you. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep using tiktok. Tik tok is getting slandered by big corps dont be fooled by the media American companies are simply intimidated by TikTok and would rather ruin their reputation than compete fairly. Im all for data privacy and would rather delete Facebook etc over tiktok as these American companies have been taking our data for years and no one has cared? Great app I love it and wont be using any of the alternatives Im sure FB/Insta will attempt to introduce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unnecessary censorship and tracking. This app is a nifty form of privacy invasion and piracy. Its the western equivalent of WeChat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unnecessary. Whilst tiktok can be funny and entertaining and it can also be fun. I was logged out of my account for violating community guidelines when I havent done anything at all. Tiktok shadowbans and takes down accounts for no reason at all and they need to sort it out. Also, when you do download tiktok keep in mind that your screen time will go up by hours and turn you brain dead especially if you are a teenager or young adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ridiculous. Absolutely one of the most unforgiving apps. TikTok is BY FAR the ONLY app that forces you or lure you into the the direction of doing content you dont want to do. Ill never understand it. I just uninstalled the app 2 days ago because I had enough. I had enough of the improper bans, and the waiting on them to reply to my support tickets. They dont care. This app doesnt care about new content creators is what Im seeing and Im glad everyone is realizing that. After some update happened earlier this month or maybe the end of March, I noticed a SIGNIFICANT drop in interactions on my account in which I made 70K followers on in 3 months LEGITIMATELY Throughout my growth Ive been rightfully banned one time for something that was an accident BUT Ive been improperly banned 4+ times, this includes innocent vids getting taken down and lives as well. Im just tired of it. I tried being patient with them but when you do that, it just makes them take longer to reply to you. So I uninstalled the app. And I lost a few thousand followers because my interactions dropped tremendously. It was to the point where I was only getting under 100 views but on average I was making 300 views. Something someone with 70K followers shouldnt be making. I was frustrated, confused and annoyed. TikTok did nothing about it, so I quit. This app punishes all the good people but let the bad people go against the rules. Ill never understand that. I see things everyday that should be taken down for community guidelines violation, but do they take it down ?? NO Theyll take down a video of me using a nerf gun I used in a video for dangerous act tho. I KNOW for a fact that the repetitive mistakes on their end for banning me improper and ect has something to do with me being shadowbanned for a month in a half now. And I just had enough. My account died as quick as it was made. And I only had TikTok fir 3 months. There are vids that had full potential to go viral that would do thousands of views in 1 hour but all of a sudden get halted on growthIll never understand that. But these have been the absolute worse 3 months Ive ever had with this app. Ive did literally everything I could do to bring my account back to life, nothing worked..they say do original and unique content?? I do it and still nothing get pushed out. But Im done with TikTok, thats all to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its all lies. You people like Im never downloading tiktok stop being such eggs because when they share the same video of another platform its the funniest video and platform doesnt make you stupid its yourself thinking that a platform is not up to your standards grow up you twits.....And for all the people saying they are spying on you like Im a 29 old man whos had three back operations I literally go to work come home playing some games eat dinner and tiktoks like you if think youre not being Spied already on how stupid are you P.S Im sorry in advance if youre the person spying on me and you see my search history trust me seek help break the stigma Much love for tiktok ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best. TikTok has changed the world of social media. Its not only the most enjoyable platform for general entertainment, it provides a lot of meaningful curated content to the users specific interests. TikTok should implement a mechanism to allow creators to limit their targeted audience by age and activity on the platform. For example as a content creator I should have the ability to restrict access to my Lives to users who are above 18 years old, have a profile picture or specific number of followers and or content. Trolling on the app by fake and underage users is a serious problem. TikTok should also create a simple photo verification system to verify users and all creators to filter unverified users from seeing or participating in their lives or content. TikTok needs to verify more creators who are significantly contributing to the venue without requiring them to be verified on competitive platforms first. This meritocracy misses the mark of rewarding loyal creators and in fact penalizes some good creators with little vetting of complaints by trolls. Lastly TikTok needs to maintain an objective platform that doesnt promote certain political narratives or agendas to build trust with creators and content consumers. We dont want social media companies controlling our thoughts. Freedom of expression is vital to the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stealing my info. Privacy man cmon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"TikTok U.K. Very Unprofessional. TikTok as a platform is a great concept, What seriously lets them down is a lack of support for when your content gets removed for a violation of their t&cs If this happens they ask that you submit an appeal and going back 6 or so months ago they were actually very good at restoring your content within an hour. but now they dont restore any videos that have been wrongly flagged, so as soon as they deem it as a violation you can no longer appeal.The not so funny thing is that you can lets say have the same video up on another account it gets flagged but then restored as not violating the T&Cs  showing it comes down to the individual staff members mood weather they will or will not reinstate. If you are lucky enough to get a reply dont expect TikTok U.K. to have actually read your appeal because you will get a generic copy paste reply which sometimes has nothing to do with your appeal and most the time it will just be instructions on how to appeal which is funny as this was the appeal meaning you cant appeal again leaving you without any help whatsoever, even if you reply back saying they havent read your appeal you will never get a reply back. You will find if you get multiple violations you will get banned from posting for a set time, and even if the violations were revoked and your content restored you will still get banned as the system doesnt take into account of the restored content deemed as not a violation so be prepared to feel like your pants have been pulled down as there is no chance in hell they will unblock your account so you have to unjustifiably wait it out knowing your have been wrongly punished and watch as your follower back goes down due to not uploading videos. My current issue is something new to me. 3-4 days ago I got banned for a live I never did back in 2020 and guess what? I wasnt even on TikTok in 2020 So how could I have gone live?? It even says I will be allowed to post again from 13/12/2020?? So Ive only got to go back to the future to get my account unblocked so now Im in limbo, I wouldnt really care if I didnt have 241 thousand followers.Unfortunately this is just a long line of issues myself and many other creators have with TikTok U.K. as recently a video emerged of an ex TikTok employee who said that the staff who look at the violations to deem weather or not they are indeed a violation often takes  a disliking to certain creators and from that moment you are tagged as that member of staff will do everything they can to ensure you get ignored and ensures you will keep getting banned and the more you get banned they higher probability your account will be removed. I have emailed every TikTok mailing address known and not once have i received a reply back, I have used their online reporting system and again my concerns go unnoticed or ignored, you as a creator are at the mercy of one office in London with a small team who decide what they want to do with you knowing you cannot do anything as its impossible to get hold of anyone other than that same office in London. All in all I have sent over 30 appeals only to be ignored so please be prepared to go through some real mental health problems because the account you have put so many hours into is just being toyed with by bullies yes it sounds sad using that word but thats what it is in a nut shell a bunch of power mad bullies who have no care for your well-being and who clearly gets enjoyment out of your misery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok. Best content app Make sure if youre using your phone number and you ever change it to change it on TikTok because you may never get back into your account ever again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop using this app. dude this app takes your data secretly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely disgusting. All of my account have been banned when I have done nothing and TikTok has logged me out of all my accounts. Sort your app out I have lost tons of videos of my family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR Definitely DELETE. I love tik tok I spend all my time watching it but I read and article that said that the creator of TikTok said if there was a app that took all your information and contacts and data well your using it and also said that Chinese people are taking our information and selling it do not trust this app (p.s)if i could rate zero would do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They sell info to the Chinese government. Tik tok has admitted to sending information to the Chinese government and selling it, DELETE THIS APP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"confused. I made a new tiktok account & I cannot make it public, change my pfp, look up audios, & my fyp is only pets. Im getting very upset because i cant do anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tiktok is great but. Hello Developer,I came to make a small review about some great things about tiktok and some not so great things. Tiktok is a great platform to make friends, chat, watch videos and expand your account. I have a couple requests. My cache was full and I was trying to get into tiktok I had a option to fix the cache but it wasnt working after waiting 5 or so minutes each time before pressing it again. I ended up deleting tiktok to make it work again. And it did but my draft were gone. I only found this out after it was deleted and I know many others have had this cache problem and had there drafts removed. Unfortunately my videos of some of my family members that Ive lost were in some videos and some videos were very precious to me. Another issue is trying to get on the fyp is very hard to get on there unless your verified or have a lot of followers I understand since some small account might not have good content or not liked by the watcher maybe there could be a separate page for people to go watch small account Im not sure. Being able to create multiple accounts (like up to 3) with an email would be great, since most people only have one email. Some things people can access and others cant. For example the enhance button where you can add lipstick or whiten your teeth and many get hate from that. Or allows you to add adjustments to your face. Also the time wrap filter some had and some didnt I think everyone should get it at the same time otherwise others cant use it for a while.People reading this I can a sure you tiktok is a amazing app These are just some ideas Im suggesting. I think we shouldnt need our phone number as some people are scared or do not want to put there phone number in. I just want to say something, people have videos that  violate the community guidelines but nothing was really wrong with the video but then there are accounts that are constantly reported and not being dealt with. Ive seen a couple of account with inappropriate profile pics but Id say its not that common.Thank you for reading x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its pretty good but Im not entirely sure about safety. So I like TikTok better than YT shorts but I dont feel entirely safe with the privacy policy and data management and stuff like that. Its fun to use when watching ur fav stuff but Im still a bit uncertain/uncomfortable with online safety reasons and problems on the news with the Chinese government.I like the way it works and I like a lot of content creators but sometimes people get banned for no reasonBut overall its an ok app. If downloading I suggest you make ur account private and only use it to like, comment, etc.Have fun and stay safe yall ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STOP IT. JUST STOP STEALING PRIVATE INFORMATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This app opens you to nothing but a horrible experience. As a creator on tiktok with over 300,000 people and growing you would think they would care about the mental health of their creators.I have attempted to reach out to tiktok so many times I have lost count. But anytime you report a problem with the app or report harassment or really anything you get an automated copy and paste response and never a follow up.For instance specifically there is a user that has made over 500 accounts to personally harass me dox me send me bomb threats in the mail as well as slander me and spam me and bully me. It has been a thorn in my side for me and my community. Now my reports are not even seen by Tiktok and it appears that I get no views on this platform because that individual has been giving mass false reports on my videos. I have sent in suggestions in on how to improve the platform and they do not care. There is no support number and there are easy fixes to this like instagrams feature that fingerprints the user and blocks any other accounts they may make.Not only that did someone leave something hateful on your post? If they block you you cant see the comments that they left on YOUR video. The entire app has oversight after oversight. If you want to be a creator or even want to be part of any community do not join tiktok it was easily the worst mistake I have ever made and Im saddened that this is happening to so many people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Security Warnings. I made up a experiment, I created 3 new accounts on 3 phones with new numbers and under new names. Everything was completely different, location tracking was off. I began just creating videos as usual and watching as usual, then I plugged my phone into my security software I have for my hosting services and discord bots. It was actively sending my email, phone number, name, all that information to a database. Then I managed to get do some magic to get into the data base in my code studio, it had lists on lists of information being sent to third party software and spam sites. I have already forwarded this to the police and government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok. I have been very impressed with the updates and usage of this app. There is something for everyone. Definitely recommend this app. If you are uncomfortable about strangers seeing your content, you can simply create a private account. It is such a fun app and with all due respect you are absurd if you do not install. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please don't ban it. Yes it steals ur info but so does every other app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Goods and bads. I am not too happy with your app at the moment,Apparently you will be adding a new feature which id a 10 minute long videos and 3minutes is enough, i would also like to say another thing you are banning people for NO absolute reason my friend although i am bot going to say her user but there was NOTHING wrong with what she posted you have done it to me and a few other people on tiktok. If you fix this then it could make tiktok a better social media platform you could also start giving people a warning before they get banned. I promise i am not a karen and i do have other reasons that are good. A good thong about tiktok is that it is a nice app for when you are frustrated you can just go on tiktok to calm you down a bit. Another good reason is that you can now make multiple accounts but ideally tiktok is not as great as some may say, people do over 18 things and i have seen it myself and other things i think if you fix these then you may just get more fortunate reviews",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great information platform. This app is entertaining and educational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great information platform. This app is entertaining and educational,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DO NOT GET THIS APP. WARNING DO NOT GET THIS APPTIKTOK IS CREATED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO STEAL YOUR INFORMATIONIF YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS APP DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Steals your info. Steals your information and sends it to China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I luv this app. I really like this app, but... I heard that you guys steal information, this breaks my heart. I cant live without this, but... I have to move on, why do you do this? You broke my heart... I thought I was safer here, the most funnest thing to me... bye......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is terrible. This app is a fun app and everything  until someone gets reported for something they didnt do . This app is so toxic too. Influencers and many other people get reported for something that never happened. They ask the creators of tiktok to give them their account back but tiktok rarely replies or never this is RIDICULOUS sort this out ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Needs work. Obviously I love Titkok Ive made a great following on here 1.5 million so far. Ive enjoyed seeing how many peoples lives Ive touched and made happy.There are some areas in need of dire attention from my personal perspective. 1: Guideline Strikes - I have had several videos of mine reported for various reasons 99% of which had all be restored after I have appealed them, yet I still get hit with a community guideline strike and now am getting warning that my account may permanently be banned. If a video gets reported and then restored it should NOT count as a guideline strike against the creator. It will only lead to termination of an account that does not merit termination. Furthermore on Guideline strikes there needs to be ALOT of improvement on these issues, I had a video of mine reported, taken down, appealed, and determined that it in fact did violate guidelines. Fair enough. But when I em see other creators doing the EXACT same thing as my video that was taken down and I report that video for the exact same thing theres magically No Violations its completly not fair for one to be taken down and not the other. TikTok needs to have actually people looking at these videos and not bots that determine it. Security: Fraud Accounts - I am personally dealing with this issue and I know many other accounts are. There are currently 3 accounts that have saved multiple videos of mine and are re-uploading them as their own. So they are making people think that these videos are mine since there is no duets, stitching., or tagging in any way. Im not getting and of the credit for my original content on my own videos that these accounts are using (of which I do not give them concern to use) the accounts in question are all identical, all there account have different names and profile photos, but non of them follow any other accounts, and all of them have the exact same Bio You Must Be Looking For These and a link to a tiny url. The other comment thing these accounts have is they ALL have only MY content in them. Ive reported these account several times, and Ive reported every videos several times aswell only to find No violations which is false there is a very big violation going on there. So one from Tiktok actually recently reached out to me telling me that what is happening is against community guidelines and that I should reporting them as pretending to be me. I did as instructed and yet again it still came up No Violations so what am I to do? TikTok is allowing these accounts to steal my content and let the public believe that these accounts are mine. Suggestion: Live Chats - Tiktok had over 1 Billions users now, I think its about time they started peering up the security by adding a Live Chat option, if there currently is one its VERY hard to find but I dont believe that there is. Most times the videos get reported and taken down there little to no explanation as to why it was taken down, or what specifically it was about that video that violates guidelines. Any video that get removed from Tiktok should be assisted s random ticket number that for which a creator can reference to if they need to appeal it. Im a live chat with an actually person from Tiktok they can use the references to help guide the Live Chat support worker to the proper video and have them explain in detail ax to why the video was specifically taken down to prevent it from happening in the future. Otherwise a lot of creators get discouraged from creating content out of fear that their account will be deactivated due to multiple guideline violations that they dont even know they are doing. The Live Chat will also support cases like mine where these accounts are stealing my content and after my self and SEVERAL others have reported it and it constantly comes up with No Violation a proper response from a Tiktok Staff member would be perfect, telling the creator Ad to WHY is doesnt violate guideline, or atleast allow the creator to plead their case to prove furthermore that they are in fact violating guidelines. All in all I love this app anc I love the content I am creating on here, Im having a blast. But I am afraid that Tiktok is just letting to many things slide and they really need to step in and up their game with the security and identity theft. Let the people talk and give them a proper answer and now some auto populated response from a Bot system. Love The BeardOh WEIRDOH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love this app. I downloaded this app 2 years ago before it was called tiktok. I think its a lot safer than other social media platforms and is just an amazing app in general. I have so much fun with it Really recommend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok is the BEST app. I'm being stalked by some here whom I blocked and they're trying to get my account deleted, but I love the platform overall.They've already mass reported my maidenshealingvoyage # and somehow had it unpopulated, but I have faith because I know I am a healing person who only wants to help others heal themselves. Thanks for all you do to keep the platform running.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Informational. I enjoy the quick tips I get from individual that do it for living and pass in it to the TikTok viewers. Also the individuals giving us an insight from where they live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app consumes your info and data.Running by the Chinese government, they can spy on you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Play this if you want the Chinese government stealing all you information. The Chinese government is using this app to steal the information of everyone who uses it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the app but. I love tiktok and my platform but my older sister owns my account and tiktok banned my lives and I dont think its fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a data-stealing app DO NOT INSTALL. This app is a critical danger of your security, despite the fact that it seems to be fun and entertaining TikTok has sent loads and loads of data to the chinese government only download this app if you dare to be at great risk Id you do not believe me look it up on google, edge. Thanks for reading,Kterry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok is evil. Everybody knows that our phones know all of our information. But why dont we care? Tiktok watches all your data on other apps, even when you dont have tiktok open. This app is full of degeneracy and makes you numb to violence, language, and sexuality. It is crazy addictive and stimulating, and after just using it for a few weeks youre already going to be trapped. Its addictive. And the amount of dopamine will ruin your brain. For the love of God, dont get tiktok.In fact just remove all social media, its a genius scheme to take over your mind and make you weak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/5. I would give this app a three out of five due To the fact that number one Im not able to update the app and Ive tried several ways to update the app. Number two my account was banned due to me being underaged when I wasnt. Also when I would need to report a problem I wouldnt get a response back and Id wait weeks and days. The app is pretty good where to the fact where youre able to post any content like for me for my secondary account Ive make edits and Id be easy to share it out to. Overall if I had the chance to talk to TikTok I would too a extent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Media Clense. Im doing a social media cleanse because all other social medias are filled with mess and fakes.. everybody is happy on ig and everybody is messy/petty on the rest but TikTok i get good entertainment by real people and its resourceful because ppl get on here and teach up to 10 million ppl to a post how to do something fun, cheap, and etc for absolutely free.. this app is 1000% percent resourceful and i only kept it solely because of that.. and i deleted all other socials to focus on myself.. TikTok made it through a whole social media cleanse.. its great",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharing personal data with third party. Not happy after reading terms and conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
banned. My account got banned for no reason. It said I had been permanently banned for violating multiple community guidelines. I didnt. This app used to be everything I did. But my account with all my videos that I put so much effort in had been deleted. My drafts. My liked videos. My favourited sounds. The creators I follow. Tiktoks reporting needs to be more secure as people reported my account for no reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TikTok changed my life. I finally found my people As an entertainer, I have been able to connect with people in new and better ways than other social media sites. It took me a while to figure it out but once I started uploading a lot, things have taken off for me in ways they never did on the other platforms. I know this sounds like some paid for review but it's not ha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STOP REMOVING MY CONTENT. I would love love love to give this app 5 stars it makes me laugh and brightens my day and I love making tiktoks. However Im getting really annoyed and tired of TikTok removing my content for reasons that are simply not true. It is also a nightmare to try and contact them as they dont respond on social media and theres no email or phone no to call. First video that got removed was my most successful (over 1000 views, hundreds of comments) I simply stated facts about a political party and it was reported for hate speech (but the man who called me another spiteful b**** still has his anti BLM profile up despite me reporting him) also it no way meets the requirements for hate speech by definition of our government and TikToks own community guidelines. It was also removed for nudity - yet I am fully clothed in a long sleeve top and jeans in the video? Most recently a video of me got taken down first for Nudity - I am literally clothed or wearing a bikini which hundreds of girls do on tiktok (I dont see them removing Kylie Jenner or Nikita Draguns videos?), secondly it was removed for Minors yet the only person in the video is me, and I am 21yrs of age which it clearly states in my bio. Im really annoyed and want my content restored. Tired of the lack of ability to contact them and have a conversation about this. TikTok if you see this please contact me. My username is @moggylouise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its not healthy or safe. All of the people I know who are obsessed with TikTok r not mentally stable and have a shorter attention span bc of TikTok. Also it u literally look at the discretion it literally starts that it tracks everything you do on your phone. It invades privacy to an unsafe degree. Do not get this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DELETE TIKTOK NOWWW. TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and can store all your data from your phone to the china company including your phone number, payment information and many more. Plz delete TikTok for your own and everyone elses safety",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok. I give this a one star because the chines government owns this and is tracking ur location and what u buy and where u live and they probably have ur ip and they collect data/info from ur phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok is great but. Tiktok is great but I think the community guidelines make absolutely no sense. I personally got my account banned for doing nothing wrong but there are creators that post very questionable things on their account. Nothing happens to them. But I do love most of the content on this app even if their rules arent fair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How much I love TikTok. I have spent lots of time on this app. I do think some is a little inappropriate but it is okay because I scroll through that. Otherwise, I understand why it is such a big hit. I think it is an amazing idea to have the option to have a private account it is the reason I have it today. I cannot wait to see what else it brings and the next big trend ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tiktok. It steals your data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They steal your info. They are literally stealing your information your ip you address God knows what there doing with it you should delete it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tik of tok. Collection of personal data* for adds, selling data, etc for shared servers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tik of tok. Collection of personal data* for adds, selling data, etc for shared servers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
". Without TikTok I dont think Id make it through quarantine, the content is really funny and I love how ppl just come together in the comments and help out But one thing I hope for them to change is to show more black lives matter content instead of shadow banning it. But overall this app is one of the best social media apps ever  Ill really miss it if its gone ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible. First of all, I cant even make an account.Its always lagging and I cant record anything. And I tried to take it off privacy and it does not let me. I am a full grown woman I am married with three kids and my name is Karen. I try to post fun memories of my kids to have them but it doesnt let me do anything. Last year my grandpa died and I wanted to share this sad moment with TikTok but it didnt let me. It deleted the video and it locked my account right away I dont know how this happened. When my mother died about eight years ago I was very disappointed I wanted to share it to social media the only platform that I could post it on  was Facebook. My uncle passed away two years ago it was a very sad moment I had recorded his death and his grave I prayed that I would be able to post it on a platform, I was very excited about this app but it turns out that its horrible. Nothing works on this dumb app. My son has no problems with this app but I cant figure out why I do hes 16 he has a full-time working job. He always spends at least five hours a day on TikTok. One day I asked him how he got everything working and he said just go to manage profile I did and nothing worked it seems like someone is hacking my account. I do not think this is a reason because I put of extremely strong password that is over eight characters long. My daughter that is 10 years old also has an app working fine. She has more than 3000 followers and everythings going great shes famous at her school and everyone loves her I am happy about this but I hate this app it doesnt work for me. My son that is 33 also has this app. He also has two kids but only one of them has TikTok. He has over 100 K followers. I tried posting a video of my dog that was having a seizure.I live in a penthouse that I pay for and it gets great Wi-Fi and great service but, Im not sure what is the problem but if this could get fixed Id really appreciate it so please reach out to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shady content. I want it off my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DELETE THIS APP NOW. Tik Tok exists for the Chinese Government to spy on your internet and smartphone behaviour. Downloading this app will put you and your personal data at risk of being misused and against your knowledge at that. Please research this if you are not convinced. A few hours of entertainment is not worth the safety risks you put yourself at when using this app. They have sneaky features and very fine print to take your data and personal details. Please dont download this app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use it wisely or it will use you. Love how we can find information that is not in the main stream media but at the same time be careful of the false information. Let your gut be the judge not your logic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dont get. This app is owned by the Chinese government they can steal things such as ur phones data including everything about you and also using facial recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TikTok. I think this app is very stupid because if someone reports your account tick-tock dont check it Bailit all they do is just delete your account and banned you so you cant make another account,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Malware. This app is a virus and it could steal you private information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Complaint. Hello TikTok. I am not happy with this system going on because my account has been taken down because apparently i have discrespected community guidelines i havent done anything to disrespect tiktok and i will be making a huge complaint if this doesnt get sorted. My account was oliviaxhalw and i need it back ASAP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beware. As with any social media app that comes out, use with moderation is vital. My time on TikTok has been anything but bad. Almost too good. I love the informative news that I am given along with the cool insights that are curated just for me. THIS APP WILL DETERIORATE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IF NOT USED PROPERLY. I found myself lying in bed watching TikToks for over three hours after I woke up and then again at night I would watch for three hours before I went to bed. They make this app easy to use as a time killer and therefore easily used any time, throughout the day. There are no warnings, nothing is presented to the user before downloading, and you must find this out yourself. I have since deleted TikTok for the past six months and feel nothing but greatness. No more artificial dopamine/serotonin hits, and everything is all-natural. I will not be going back.  PLEASE, use at your own discretion. BEWARE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Privacy. We cant even watch the videos without someone knowing now? We cant share it without notifying the creator. They are adding so many useless and unwanted features to the app and its turning into Snapchat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Community Guidelines. this app deletes and bans some accounts for no reason. people would be racist, homophobic or just being a mean person, and tiktok doesnt do anything. i posted videos about artwork that were perfectly appropriate with young children and not only i got shadowbanned multiple times, my account was deleted. this app doesnt do anything about bullying or harassment and it really is ridiculous and needs to be sorted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Life changing experience. This app has allowed me to express multiple parts of myself and spread a positive message through my platform I will continue create content and cant wait see where TikTok takes me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notifications. This app is a really good creative way to express yourself however the contact system is very hard as you can never reach anyone. My account @junaydnewman with over 150k followers got unfairly banned permanently and the account had never been post banned or live banned before. Tried contacting with no help what so ever. For the viewer its a really good app but content creators its hard not to get annoyed at times. Tiktok if you see this please review my ban. I do still recommend the app if you have free time on your hands :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"100% great app. When i first started TikTok it was called musical.ly it was fun and enjoyable. For a while after TikTok was introduced again it was fun and enjoyable, the app has bought my confidence out a lot. There are so many different types or categories to choose from to watch. Everyones for you page is different it depends on your own interests. Since the lockdown has happened so many people have downloaded the app but unfortunately it is becoming a lot more toxic. I would only recommend this app if you have a stable mental health. Since the lockdown the bullying and hate has become more frequent. If the owner of the app was too actually act upon the bullying then the app would be fun and enjoyable again, right now its not. Another thing that needs to be sorted are the guidelines and what is classed as violations. Recently Ive had people post personal information about me and when I report the videos I get told  they dont violate the guidelines even through it clearly states anyone posting personal information about someone is a violation in the guidelines. Not just that but having videos removed for literally nothing. Yes I get them restored but if they are restored they obviously arent a violation so why are they removed in the first place. Another issue is contacting tiktok via email, whenever Ive emailed them about a problem Ive never had an actual response or if I have then it irrelevant to the situation Ive mentioned in the email.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
